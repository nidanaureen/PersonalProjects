13913,80770,18-08-2010,177109,Michael,"My girlfriend and I hadn't known Alina before we took the leap of faith to rent her flat. Alina just couldn't be nicer! Her flat is comfortable, homey, very sunny, and quiet at night. Her diverse neighborhood rocks! It's full of excellent eateries of varying ethnicities, good supermarkets, etc., etc. Her place is about a 10-minute walk to the Finsbury Park tube stop, and there are also several buses that ply Stroud Green Road. The Piccadilly and Victoria tube lines that serve Finsbury Park are very dependable and come frequently. My only caveat is if you are unwilling to take 20- to 40-minute commutes to downtown London attractions and money is no object, you will prefer to stay downtown. But for anyone else, you will love your experience of living in a real, untouristy neighborhood and dealing with a generous, warm-hearted woman I'm happy to call a new friend."
13913,367568,11-07-2011,19835707,Mathias,Alina was a really good host. The flat is clean and tidy - and really close to Finsbury Park station which is quite close to Central London. I recommend Alina to everyone. 
13913,529579,13-09-2011,1110304,Kristin,Alina is an amazing host. She made me feel right at home. It was more like hanging out with a friend than a complete stranger. She's very sweet and makes a mean espresso. There are tons of places right around flat to eat and market is close in case you want to cook. I would definitely stay here again if I was in London. Thanks Alina you're awesome.
13913,595481,03-10-2011,1216358,Camilla,"Alina's place is so nice, the room is big and clean, and the bed is huge. Alina is a great host, and she made sure I had everything I needed, for instance she had put clean towels on the bed for me:) I felt very at home in her place. Aside from that she really helped me out with a lot of things, and even helped me find a permanent place to live in London. So overall a great place to stay with a great girl."
13913,612947,09-10-2011,490840,Jorik,"Nice location in Islington area, good for short business trip. House is OK, host is very friendly."
13913,4847959,28-05-2013,6405442,Vera,"I'm very happy to have been Alina's guest! We've had great time in London and enjoyed our stay. Alina is a great host, we felt us so welcomed by her! <br/>Alina's house location is very convenient, it's only 5 min walk to Finsbury Park tube station and also a direct (Picadilly) line to Heathrow Airport (in case yu have an early departure you can use the opportunity to sleep a bit in the train :) <br/>The flat itself is very nice and clean and comfortable, especially the double-bed with new mattress, I slept like a newborn :) And also the red sofa on the small roof terrace is great, I enjoyed the last night London sky!<br/>To all who is going to visit London I highly reccomend Alina and her beautiful house to stay in. Alina, thank you so much and I hope to see you one day again!"
13913,8142329,17-10-2013,9195551,Honi,"I stayed with Alina in her flat in London for a week. It's a wonderful home with a warm feeling and everything you need. Alina went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and we shared some great chats and meals. I recommend Alina's place to anyone looking for a home for a while in London, and look forward to seeing Alina again. "

13913,46669566,12-09-2015,42970248,Oleh,"Alina's flat is exceptional one.  <br/>I have to say i have never been to such an atmospheric place like her flat.<br/>Plenty of stunning art items around and all of these pictures and drawings are magnificent and inspirational.<br/>The kitchen is AMAZING. Huge window,  very bright and cozy  furnished with great equipment.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this flat, <br/>i have had numerous short term rent in rent<br/>and this one is number one to me.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
13913,64559033,05-03-2016,45337884,Mo,"The House is a piece of Art , there are beautiful portraits everywhere ,  so close to the tube station , on piccaddily and Victoria lines , the host alina is very friendly , welcoming , and polite person , highly recommended"

13913,451955791,12-05-2019,58728173,Charles,"Alina's place is cosy, convenient, and full of eclectic artwork,  and furnishings made by herself personally. She met me at the door and instantly made me feel at home. Entrance is on a major road but the flat is set back so there is very little noise from the street."
13913,467269212,10-06-2019,2291517,Andrew,"Alina, was very quick to respond. Thoughtful and accommodating. Would definitely recommend."
13913,538005731,29-09-2019,7253695,Bart,Alina is an amazing host who welcomed me warmly and was always up for a talk. Her place is in a nice neighborhood with lots of great restaurants around.
13913,539957261,02-10-2019,45592945,John,Alina is a very relaxed and friendly host who made me completely welcome.  Whilst the room fronted the main road there was no noise and a comfortable bed made for a great night's sleep.  The location is great with so many bars and restaurants on the doorstep.
13913,543287825,07-10-2019,28531625,Philip,Felt at home - Alina is an excellent host - very friendly - makes you feel wanted not just tolerated - many thanks
13913,568976830,25-11-2019,38999586,Ania,"Alina’s place is great! It’s very stylish and cosy at the same time. She is a great host, quick at responding and very accommodating. I would definitely stay at Alina’s again."
13913,609079783,22-02-2020,336060662,Samuel,Outstanding host. Got along great.
13913,5.00561E+17,21-11-2021,366903575,Glenn,"Exactly what I needed! Hostels don't do it for me and hotels bore me. I'm glad I chose a place which displayed aesthetically pleasing art which in turn allowed me to gain the motivation to do what I came there to do, which is to write! Thanks Alina."
13913,5.97622E+17,04-04-2022,2941217,Kévin,"If the room is available, just take it !"
13913,6.28813E+17,17-05-2022,32486646,Saarah,"Alina's flat is lovely and quirky, with art all around which makes for a lovely atmosphere. <br/>It feels like a comfortable place to stay, with nice touches to personalise your stay.<br/>It was great to view the pieces of art where each one told a story :)<br/>Alina was a lovely and friendly person, giving lots of advice and explaining the art in her flat.<br/>It is on a road lined with many restaurants and cafes and close by supermarkets.<br/>It is an ideal location for those travelling by Eurostar and wanting to avoid staying in the busy Kings Cross area. <br/>There is a direct overground train to St Pancras International from Finsbury Park station (it's only 1 or 2 stops from what I remember) with more than enough time to arrive at St Pancras."
13913,6.31032E+17,20-05-2022,203803703,Mallin,"This is the most cosy and beautifully-decorated flat, in a lovely area. Alina was warm and kind, and made me feel very welcome in London. I would highly recommend staying here if you have the chance!"
13913,6.32423E+17,22-05-2022,172968198,Ged,"Alina was very welcoming, friendly  and helpful.  Home from home, with everything you need during your stay in the area. Location ideal for visiting London.<br/>Finsbury Park tube a 15 minute walk and there are plenty of parks and cafes nearby.<br/>I would stay again."

13913,6.52011E+17,18-06-2022,77938322,Cristina,"Alina is a great host, very friendly, relaxed, and warm. The room is very big, the bed is very comfortable. There is a lot of art all around you, which I really appreciated. The bathroom is nice and clean, shower is nice as well. It was quiet and very comfortable, I will stay again when visiting London."
13913,6.55595E+17,23-06-2022,20969189,Gemma,I had a lovely + easy stay in Alina’s flat which was really confortable and well located. Thanks!

13913,7.20334E+17,20-09-2022,217491570,Violeta,Cancelled on the same day I arrived to London
13913,7.21519E+17,22-09-2022,63837960,Alexander,Great flat for a short stay with everything you could need. Alina was very pleasant and we had some nice chats. Recommended!

13913,7.28874E+17,02-10-2022,12977653,Mateusz,Everything was fine! Strongly recommended :)<br/>Alina was a great host.
13913,7.3317E+17,08-10-2022,63761526,Nicole,"Alina’s place was really cosy and homey, she was very welcoming and communicative about check in and check out. I had a great stay there, it’s very well-connected to central London and was very clean and tidy - thanks Alina!"
13913,7.33874E+17,09-10-2022,140184012,Gwen,Alina is a wonderful and friendly host. We loved staying at her flat as it was such a chilled vibe. Location is amazing. <br/>Thank you so much.
13913,7.39665E+17,17-10-2022,13510722,Irene,"Alina's house is perfect if you are someone who likes to experience the real city of London. The area is not yet heavily touristed and Alina lives a 5 min walk from Finsbury Park and the station and the street she is in is full of shops and restaurants.<br/>Alina is very kind and helpful, we had great chats. highly recommended"
13913,7.49095E+17,30-10-2022,276919648,Richard,Great location with easy access to shops and services in the area
13913,7.79612E+17,11-12-2022,96027098,Jp,Very helpful and good host!
13913,1.0333E+18,26-11-2023,457103259,Dennis,"The accommodation was great. I particularly liked the fact that you could enjoy your breakfast in the cosy kitchen in the sun when it was shining. ☀️<br/>The flat is very well located. It is quiet at night. There are various shops and restaurants nearby. You can also get anywhere relatively quickly from there by public transport.<br/>What's more, Alina is a great person. If I ever come to London again, this will be my first port of call 😃"
15400,21032,21-12-2009,53815,Hailey,"We loved staying at Phillipa's place in Chelsea. The flat was lovely, and the neighborhood was great. Lots of fun shops, and close to two metro stops. We would love to stay there again!"
15400,109674,02-10-2010,148145,Garth,"A comfortable apartment conveniently located near shops, restaurants and tube stations. <br/>Philippa is a very helpful and friendly hostess. We would recommend her and her apartment to anyone.<br/>Thank you Philippa for an enjoyable holiday."
15400,120941,17-10-2010,112795,Cédric,"I really enjoyed my week at Philippa's, the place is ideally situated in Chelsea, and she is a very kind host, I would definitely recommend that you stay there, I will again without any doubt. "
15400,192035,04-03-2011,308956,Rob,"I am a little late reviewing this but it is important to me that I do.  Look, the place is in a great location and the neighbor was very friendly.  The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England.<br/><br/>However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there.  We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc).  It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things:<br/>1)  Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently.  There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here.<br/>2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics.<br/><br/>The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated.  We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place.  However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault.  There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did.  Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building.<br/><br/>So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here."
15400,219843,07-04-2011,427875,Maria,"Very nice flat, and extremely well-located. Great for couples and single travelers. It is small and notes in the lobby indicate that the neighbors don't take kindly to noise--if you are a large family or group, this is probably not the place for you.<br/><br/>Philippa herself was a great host--I very much enjoyed meeting her. She left a great selection of helpful tourist info. "
15400,229267,17-04-2011,472341,Lisa,"This is a superior option to staying at a hotel in London, especially when considering the price of London hotels.  <br/><br/>The place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs.  There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner.  If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank  (about 20 mins total time).   A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too.  And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very cute, perfectly clean and very well out-fitted.  Everything was recieved exactly as promised in the ad.  Phillipa was a kind and helpful host.  We would definitely recommend this place.  Great visit!"
15400,242805,27-04-2011,505370,Lorena,"Within less than 10 minutes of South Kensington and 15 minutes of Sloane Square tube stations, there are several buses even closest to the apartment such as line 14, 19 and 11 (if I remember well). Some of the buses run all night so if you want to go out and are a little low on money for the cab you can always take one f them to go home!<br/>It is ideal if you want to do some sightseeing and party in London while living in a nice and calm area. Of course you'll have to be very quiet while coming back home because it is a residential area and that's what make it so nice. <br/>Lovely shop stores around on King's road, the Saatchi gallery is at 10 minutes walking, the grocery store is literally  around the corner.<br/>Saint-Pancras station for those who take the Eurostar is in the same tube station at 45 minutes top. Most of the tourist spots are within 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very quiet at night a little less in the morning because it is located next to a store delivery parking. No worries then close the windows turn on the air conditioner or put some ear plugs if you are like me (light sleeper) it only lasts an hour.<br/><br/>It is exactly as indicated in the add. Beautiful natural light that makes it very bright. Comfortable bed, clean bathroom with fresh towels and toilet paper (seems silly to point it but very useful when you arrive late and haven't got time to go to the market) and an equipped kitchen. Everything you need for your stay as a true Londoner!<br/><br/>Philippa is a very lovely and warm lady. I am sure she will make your stay as comfortable as ours. <br/>I am glad I've met her and I hope next time I'll go to London her appartment will be free for me to rent it! <br/><br/>Thank you again for everything Philippa!! :) "
15400,458003,19-08-2011,565629,Lim,"Wonderful location! 10min stroll to the tube and as we found out, fantastic bus connections to lots of sightseeing spots of London. <br/>Having a well equipped kitchen and waitrose supermarket next door helps to whip up a good meal in pricy London. <br/>Apartment is clean and cozy. <br/>Philippa is very helpful and very welcoming. <br/>Highly recommend her apartment to all visitors looking to enjoy London for short and long stays. "
15400,488228,30-08-2011,928894,Jennifer,"Located in a convenient and central area of London, this flat is the perfect place for tourists looking for an affordable home base. Close to 2 tube stops and several bus lines, the flat is close to great shops and in a nice residential area. You'll have to be respectful of your neighbors if coming in late at night or early in the morning but it also means a peaceful time for yourself. The amenities and apartment are just as the photos and description indicate. The host is very helpful and accommodating. I'd love to stay here again on a return trip to London! "
15400,528262,13-09-2011,969713,Valerie,"Delightful, charming hostess.  Very clean, and wonderful neighborhood.  Only one bus to the city, lots of amenities nearby, very safe area, great pubs nearby, went for evening walks, great coffee shop in the morning....Thanks Philippa!"
15400,553595,21-09-2011,859564,S M,"The flat is exactly as it is shown in the photographs.<br/>My flight in was very late; but Philippa was there to meet me at the flat; and seems a very good hostess.<br/>As I was traveling alone, it was nice to know that she lives nearby for added security.<br/>The building is quite secure, and the flat itself has very good locks; and also locking windows with a little separate key.<br/>Even being on the ground floor, I felt very safe there.<br/>I didn't mind the street noise at all, as we live on a busy street at home.<br/>The bedroom has lovely thick curtains, so you can get a great sleep in the very comfy bed ,and not be woken up by light in the mornings.<br/>The flat is spotless throughout, and has lots of hot water for showers.<br/>It's got absolutely everything you would need; from hairdryer to iron, to all the kitchen equipment needed for cooking.<br/>It's really easy to get around London from there : <br/>I recommend buying an Oyster Transport pass for the Tube and buses. <br/>I was even able to use it on a couple of regular trains.<br/>Lots of great shops right nearby, including a wonderful large grocery store.<br/>This was my first experience with AirBnB, though I always rent apartments when I travel;  and I was VERY pleased with it all.<br/>Thanks, Philippa ;  for sharing your cosy home with others!<br/>I would love to stay there on another visit!<br/>"
15400,635891,17-10-2011,196656,Virginia,"Philippa is a wonderful host and a most charming woman - the apartment was lovely, the location perfect, the stay was completely hassle and problem free and I look forward to returning as soon as I can."
15400,680472,01-11-2011,495545,Alessia,"My parents came to London and needed a place to stay. I booked Philippa's apartment because I loved the position and the pictures on Airbnb. <br/>I arrived a day before my parents and went to Philippa to do the check in. She was amazing! So kind! <br/>The flat was super clean and tidy and very welcoming. I loved it at first glance!<br/>I recommend the flat because has an extraordinary position ( it's in the heart of Chelsea, in Kings road!!!) and Philippa is an amazing host.<br/>I definitely will rent again the flat in future!"
15400,864326,16-01-2012,583352,Carollyn,this is a wonderful little bolt hole in the lovely area of Chelsea - very conveniently located near Kings Road and lots of public transport. Highly recommended for short or medium stays. Thanks Phillipa.
15400,1027529,21-03-2012,1767934,Melanie,"I enjoyed my stay at Phillipa's apartment.  It was within easy walking distance to the underground station and was in an attractive and upmarket part of London.  It was a bonus having Waitrose supermarket in the next street.  Although I didn't get to meet Phillipa ( she was overseas) I had regular contact with her and she was concerned that I had a pleasant stay and everything I needed.  I would recommend  the apartment for both a long or short term stay in London. <br/>Melanie Brown"
15400,1064020,31-03-2012,1775383,Brando,"We had a wonderful stay in Philippa's apartment. Comfortable, quiet and very clean. The aparment is in a very nice location with all types of restaurants and a Waitrose supermarket right around the corner. In a few minutes you can walk to the river, over the bridge and into Battersea park! <br/><br/>I didn't get a chance to meet Philippa in person as she was abroad, but she was very friendly and helpful over the phone and via email. We had everything we needed and it was a real pleasure to stay there. Thank you Philippa! "
15400,1354646,27-05-2012,1262848,Tony,"As a solo mature aged traveller wanting to spend some time in London, it was perfect. location  as  it is a short walk (about 12 mins) to South Kensington underground which gives you access to 3 main train lines Piccadilly, District and Circle.It is also just of Kings Roads in Chelsea giving you access to everything you need for your stay in London including supermarkets,eateries, post office and a great pub around the corner called the Builders Arms. Everything for me was perfect in the apartment. Nothing was not available that I needed. Philippa is a wonderful host and had prepared the apartment ready for easy access. Everything was explained and all easy to use. I felt very secure in the apartment which is very light and airy. For me it was my perfect choice for my stay in London, made even more enjoyable in having Philippa as your host who certainly has a great apartment for one or 2 people. Many thanks. Philippa as greatly appreciate the opportunity of staying in your Chelsea pad. It is perfect"
15400,1491714,16-06-2012,2384243,José Henrique,"We've been traveling to <br/>london every year, it was our first time in Philippa's flat and it was great. Everything is perfect and the location.... We loved! Thank you Philippa!!"
15400,1613474,02-07-2012,215772,Jason,"Very nice flat  with a lot of amenities, and it's very quiet! I stayed here for a couple of days this summer and would definitely stay again. <br/><br/>Philippa was a bit hard to reach via phone / email at times, but I think I just caught her while she was doing some heavy traveling. Overall the trip worked out well and both she and Mary (a local tenant) were quite accommodating! "
15400,1718338,16-07-2012,2387745,Silvia,"El departamento esta muy bien ubicado y equipado.<br/>La persona que nos recibio, fue muy amable en indicarnos donde ir a comprar comida en el horario que llegamos. Y Philipa nos permitio dejar nuestras valijas mas tarde del horario de salida.<br/>Tiene un gran defecto que es el ruido de camiones en la semana, muy temprano por la mañana, ya que hay un negocio de muebles a la vuelta y los camiones estacionan justo en la calle a la que da la habitacion y hacen mucho ruido.<br/>El sillon cama no es muy comodo para descansar.<br/>Me resulto algo incomodo que Philippa llegue al departamento sin aviso previo, y que revise todo, nunca me paso algo asi, no se si es algo comun en Londres, pero he alquilado mas departamentos en otras ciudades, y eso me resulto algo molesto y extraño."
15400,1789153,24-07-2012,382420,Ruth,"What a wonderful first time London experience! From the very beginning Philippa, our host, was informative, helpful and open. Philippa was unable to meet us but Mary her friend and neighbor helped us settle iin and offered us umbrellas for our rainy stay.<br/><br/>The apartment was wonderfully located with a supermarket, pastry shops and so many restaurants within walking distance, ie just around the corner. Ditto for public transportation - bus stop just around the corner that served us as ""tour"" buses since the routes went by every known site you could wish to visit. Within walking distance the Victoria and Albert museum and the Natural history musuem, the beautiful church of St. Luke with its gardens just at the end of the street.<br/><br/>And the apartment itself was incredibly comfortable, with a washing machine and dishwasher and enough kitchen utensils for breakfast or any other meal you would want to prepare.<br/><br/>The neighborhood was exceptionally  quiet  in the evening with only the routine morning noise of the city of London waking in the morning.<br/><br/>I recommend Philippa and her home  very highly and hope to return quite soon.<br/><br/>Ruth"
15400,2140878,30-08-2012,164949,Carla,"Thank you for letting us stay in your beautiful flat. The location was excellent; you can almost see the bus stop from the front door! There is also plenty of shopping close by. The only tiny complaint we had was that apartment was on the first floor and it could be a little loud in the mornings. If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. But I would definitely recommend this place!"
15400,2228512,08-09-2012,2664072,Katherine,"Just as pictured - tidy, comfortable and quiet, with a nice bathroom, a well stocked kitchen, and a washer/dryer/ironing board/iron which is wonderful if you opt to stay a full week or more. With a Waitrose and an M&S both just around the corner, you'll be all set!<br/><br/>It's an incredibly convenient location - just off King's Road, only 10 min. walk to the South Kensington stop (near the V&A and within walking distance of Royal Albert Hall and Hyde Park, etc.) and ~10-15 min. walk to Sloan Square.  Philippa was also an excellent host, always very helpful and responsive.<br/><br/>We only wish we'd been able to stay another week. A wonderful value, and I'm sure we'll try to stay again the next time we're in London!"
15400,2298601,16-09-2012,2603702,Deva,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as promised. We found the location excellent -- convenient to bus and tube, with lots of shops nearby-- and all the appliances and furnishings excellent. Phillipa made checking in and out a breeze, and kindly left us some milk in the fridge, and made certain we understood how everything worked.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks are things the owner really couldn't control: the noise from the trucks unloading right outside in the mornings (not too bad with windows closed), and the resulting lack of air circulation at night. <br/><br/>I would certainly recommend this flat to a couple looking for a clean, comfortable, well-equipped rental at a great price and in a great location!"
15400,2425906,27-09-2012,733596,LaValle,"The Bright Chelsea Apartment was just that. The flat is exactly as advertised ~ compact yet complete with everything you might need. Both of us arrived from Amsterdam a day into head colds. Philippa was kind enough to direct us to the ""electric fire"" she keeps tucked away so we were able to be a bit warmer on our sickest day.<br/><br/>Philippa is a great host making certain we knew where everything was and how it operated in the flat. We enjoyed being on the ground level for a change. Usually our accommodations  away from home seem to be on the fifth and sixth floors without lifts.<br/><br/>Philippa will be starting a remodeling soon so it wil be interesting to stay when she has completed that to see the changes. They undoubtedly will be stunning.<br/><br/>Special note: I needed to fax a document back to the States and asked Philippa about businesses that provided those such as FedEx and MailBoxes Etc. There is a MBE near the South Kensington Underground however Philippa advised that her printer should do that (wouldn't connect for me as a scanner but worked fine as a copier/printer). The alternative were free services at the Town Hall across Kings Road. I ended up at the library at that building. William helped me join the library and then made an appointment for me at the computer station that would scan my document so I could send it as an attachment to an email.<br/><br/>"
15400,3290846,06-01-2013,1457643,Alexander,"Philippa was a very friendly, warm and caring host. We arrived very early - which meant that the guest before us was still in the flat, so Pilippa showed as a nice British bar/restaurant and had (very early ;) ) lunch with us - thanks for that! :) The room was very clean, big enough for the two of us and very easy to reach via bus and metro. You need about 20 minutes by bus and about 10 minutes by metro to get to the center. <br/><br/>We can only recommend this flat as accommodation and Philippa as a host!"
15400,3679074,03-03-2013,3726941,Natalie,"Philippa's flat in Chelsea is absolutely adorable. It is warm, cosy, welcoming, and simply a delightful space. In a marvellous location; a secure building;  I had a most enjoyable stay. Thank you so much!"

15400,8175572,19-10-2013,1631583,Brad,A wonderful location. Philippa's home has everything you need & is very comfortable...feels like home. Thanks again.
15400,8539696,04-11-2013,9500288,Tom,"Our first and very positive airbnb experience. The apt. was exactly as pictured on airbnb. No surprises and no disappointments. On arrival was clean and tidy. Key exchange went smoothly. Cozy but plenty of space for two people. Everything worked. WiFi was excellent.Communication via email with Phillipa was effortless. Location is great with easy access to stores, restaurants, buses and  underground. Neighborhood was quiet and safe. Highly recommended. Would definitely stay there again."
15400,8967459,29-11-2013,9235247,Dorothy B,"Wonderful location just off the Kings Rd. The flat was spotless, nicely decorated, good internet, comfy bed, plenty of hot water,small, but very well equipped kitchen. Good ground floor location so no need to lug luggage up stairs for us elderly folk. Philippa was a great host- answered all my questions promptly. Hope to stay there again."
15400,9561117,02-01-2014,10536261,Alison,We had a very comfortable stay in Chelsea Manor Street. Close to transport and all the things we wanted to do. Really nice to feel that we were at home. Philippa was overseas when we were there but arranged key pickup and answered our questions promptly. 
15400,9854993,14-01-2014,10602959,Vasily,It was a great two week spend at the place. Great location and everything you need to fell boom away from home.
15400,9925873,20-01-2014,4293299,Vera,"Lovely apartment, great location, clean. Nice area, King's Road round the corner. 2 Minutes to busstop. Hardly any traffic in the street. Some noise early in the morning (Waitrose is very near), but it would be difficult to find a more quiet place so central in London. Good communication with Philippa."
15400,12109023,23-04-2014,3918812,Rachel,"This Chelsea apartment is a great place for visiting London. It is perfectly located, with King's Road shops around the corner, buses going in all directions, and half way between two tube stations.<br/>The apartment is sunny and cosy and very easy to live in.<br/>Philippa is just an email away. It is a secure building.<br/>We toured all over London from here."
15400,13308190,25-05-2014,13367361,Louise,"First time on Airbnb,<br/><br/>Philippa was very kind, welcoming and accomodating.<br/>The flat is lovely, and as clean and quiet as said in the comments.<br/>The location was perfect, next to underground station on the main lines.<br/><br/>We had there a wonderful time, and would be happy to stay there again !"
15400,13700395,02-06-2014,15528928,Gary,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I can only hope that future rentals are this positive. <br/><br/>Excellent apartment and exactly as described in the listing, down to the nice pub around the corner and the very relaxing gardens at St. Luke's. Safe, vibrant neighborhood and the location can't be beat. Bus stops right around the corner, underground stations a 3 minute bus ride or 10 minute walk away. Full service market also right around the corner. Several eating choices within a short walk.  The apartment was warm and cozy and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. <br/><br/>Philippa was an outstanding host. Once we booked she provided us a wealth of information on the apartment and the neighborhood to get us orientated and despite the late hour of our arrival she was there to meet us and get us settled. The apartment has internet and Philippa had a number of maps and guides to help plan our London vacation. If relaxing with a good book is on the agenda, she has a nice assortment to choose from. <br/><br/>All-in-all a five star experience. I would not hesitate to recommend Philippa's apartment to my friends. <br/><br/><br/> "
15400,13993907,09-06-2014,8277303,Rokas,"Nice host, tidy and well-equipped apartment, great location."
15400,14921686,29-06-2014,16199237,Robert,"This was our first BnB experience and we were very pleased.  The apartment was clean and comfortable and the owner was very friendly and helpful.  A delightful lady from upstairs made our stay more enjoyable and managed a maintenance issue while we were out.  Location was excellent, directly on the bus lines and short walks to two tube stations.  Many food/pub choices minutes away and the Waitrose market was just around the corner.  We felt totally comfortable with the neighborhood and although we were on a first floor, it was actually very quiet and we slept well.  Starts to get a little noisy some mornings at 8, but we were well on on way to heading out for the morning.  We appreciated the absolute absence of smoke in the apartment.  I can easily recommend this apartment and location to anyone!"
15400,15264060,06-07-2014,11959525,Michael,"Philippa’s little apartment was perfect for my week’s stay in London. Very well located and very accessible to public transport, pubs and restaurants. All amenities were readily at hand. If only I had realised that there was an air conditioning unit above front door before my last days stay, especially as London probably experienced its hottest days of the summer during my stay! I would certainly recommend this apartment and hope to stay there on my next London trip. Mike"
15400,17088763,07-08-2014,12970089,Andrew,A small flat off the Kings Road in Chelsea which we took for a month.  Probably a bit small for a full month. 15-20 minutes walk from Sloane Square it is a good position save for one glaring fault.  It is on the corner of Hemus Place (see Google street view) which contains the loading docks and delivery areas for Habitat and Waitrose and the trucks can start form 6:00 AM some mornings and 7:00 AM most!  A sleep in is not an option. A minor but inconvenient matter was the dish washer was non functional when we arrived and as the owner was overseas nothing could be done.    Generally satisfactory!
15400,23566366,05-12-2014,2984861,Roy,"A wonderful place to stay in London! It was easy to get to anywhere in London, situated between South Kensington and Sloane Square Tube stops. The first day we walked from the apartment to Westminister Abbey and Parliament. We loved the area, the walk along Kings Rd was one we did often and will miss. The flat was well appointed and Philippa gave us a thorough introduction to everything in the apartment before she left. Great food stores nearby, Waitrose and M&S.  If we go back to London we would want to stay here again. "
15400,27598311,08-03-2015,6608797,Shannon,"Philippa is a lovely hostess and very accommodating. The flat was just as described, and was perfect for my 2-week venture in London. Philippa's flat is very comfortable and private, and close to all amenities. I would definitely recommend it as a great place to stay while exploring London. "
15400,28046390,16-03-2015,102375,Andrew,"Nice friendly welcome from Philippa, great compact flat in good location."
15400,29497446,08-04-2015,28190119,Henry,"As previously arranged, we contacted Philippa when we arrived at the neighborhood Tube Station in London, and then met her in person at her flat just a few minutes later. She gave us a very thorough introduction to all aspects such as Kitchen, laundry, garbage, etc and welcomed any questions that we had. The flat and location were exactly as described in the listing, and, in fact, exceeded it.  "
15400,32758978,21-05-2015,7318364,Maria,Great flat and perfectly placed! Philippa was wonderful and explained everything in detail. We felt very welcome and safe there.
15400,34004222,03-06-2015,16233502,Stephanie,"The flat is very comfortable, clean and in a wonderful area. We felt like at home. Communication with Philippa was easy and she was very helpful and accommodating. We had a great stay."
15400,34331228,07-06-2015,7002325,Katherine,"This is a perfect location for museums the V and A and the Natural History Museum. The 211 bus got me to Victoria Station in minutes; everything I needed close by - truly a comfortable, safe and pleasant venue for my solo city break. "
15400,35608823,20-06-2015,22851074,Michael,"Phillipa's apartment is clean, comfortable, well equipped, filled with natural light, and very well located. Very suitable for 1 person or a couple. As other reviewers have noted, it is behind the loading docks of two shops BUT double glazed windows throughout and heavy curtains in the bedroom minimised noise and light, with no problem for me on a morning I wished to sleep in. With a fan in the bedroom, air conditioning in the central hall and heating throughout, this would be a comfortable choice in any season. Ground floor location gives it convenient access with the Kings Rd - and buses - within 2 min. walk and tube within 12 min walk. "
15400,36030481,24-06-2015,4534043,Karah,Philippa's apartment was wonderful!! It was cozy and charming and in the best location. Communication with her was perfect and we found the place easily. She provided detailed instructions for everything in the apartment. We felt very at home. 
15400,37766478,10-07-2015,4443388,Udatta,"We booked the flat for 4 days in early July. Communication with Phillipa was excellent prior to our arrival. Unfortunately, we did not meet either Phillipa or any other person during our stay. Fortunately, we were able to get to the keys and successfully enter the apartment. The apartment itself was nice and comfortable. The location has its good and bad points. First the good - because of its location near a lot of nice shopping and restaurants (including a supermarket, Waitrose, nearby) our stay was comfortable. The number 11 bus which stops nearby takes you to within 15 minutes walking of most major sights. The bad thing about the location is it is right behind the Waitrose. ON our first morning we were woken up early by a lot of delivery truck noise. The dumpsters nearby are also a bit of an eyesore. But we kept the curtains drawn and were out most of the day so those things were soon forgotten. Overall we were pleased with our stay. "
15400,38136941,13-07-2015,3321262,Beth Ann,"We had a wonderful stay at Philippa's cozy flat. It was perfectly located for our purposes, close to transportation, very comfortable, clean and easy to feel at home. <br/>In terms of what matters to us, the kitchen had what we needed, the shower was strong, the bed comfortable, and the AC worked well. <br/>Communication with Philippa was pleasant, instructions were clear, and Mary was very nice when we arrived later than expected due to tube strike. <br/>All in all, a terrific experience. We would definitely stay again and recommend highly to others. <br/>Thank you, Philippa!"
15400,39030382,20-07-2015,35433985,Kathleen,"Philippa was very responsive to all communication and very thorough in her descriptions about how everything worked. She was not in the country during our stay but it is pretty much a turn key operation and there was a neighbor who we could have contacted if necessary. The apartment is as pictured and described on the website. Great neighborhood with excellent shopping dining and lots of pubs and clubs. little bit of a walk to the subway, but there are buses, taxis and uber so we had no trouble getting around. The apartment has all of the conveniences you could need or want. Dishwasher, washer and dryer and Air conditioning unit and all worked flawlessly. We would definitely stay here again."
15400,40096686,28-07-2015,15031078,Tricia,Our stay of 6 days in London at Philippa's apartment was very successful. The Apartment was as advised and being just off Kings Road was ideal. We would definitely use it again.  
15400,66557008,23-03-2016,8657262,Kirsten,"I had an excellent stay in Philippa's flat. Although she was away when we arrived, she made arrangements for us to acquire the keys and receive a tour of the apartment. The flat is so cute, perfect for 1 or a couple.<br/><br/>The apartment is located in a lovely neighbourhood, with many excellent bars and restaurants as well as 2 underground stations within in walking distance. We had no issues getting around the city while staying based in Chelsea."
15400,69724613,12-04-2016,27385446,Andrew,"I stayed in Philippa's apartment for a week while in London on business. The apartment was perfect for me. It had everything I wanted, it was very clean and tidy, the shower was terrific, it was handy to public transport, it was on the ground floor but very safe and secure. I will certainly try to stay here the next time I am in London."
15400,76869648,29-05-2016,51941207,Kurt,The flat is amazing. Its close to the bus stop and just a minute walk to all the pubs. I would recommend this apartment to anyone who want to stay in Chelsea. 
15400,82154888,26-06-2016,4785780,Kelly,"Good communication prior to arrival and Phillipa was there to welcome us despite late plane. Our second stay at her apt. Great location close to two tube stations, restaurants, shopping and a grocery store around the corner if you want to cook. Fully equipped. Beautiful little church park at the end of the street. Great place from which to explore London. "
15400,88973916,26-07-2016,1444416,Melanie,"I cannot recommend this flat highly enough. It was lovely, clean, easy check-in and -out, excellent location; everything you could hope for. Honestly, stop your search and stay here. It's the perfect slice of London life and British hospitality provided by Philippa. "
15400,93909724,14-08-2016,86225506,Ruhi,Perfectly located to explore London city at its best!
15400,97704669,28-08-2016,20856348,Cristina,"I loved my 6-night stay at this adorable apartment! It's compact but just right for just one person. It was also an extremely convenient 2-minute walk to my office along with a variety of shops, restaurants, and pubs. The ground floor location was a bit strange at first, as I felt that people on the street could see me in the apartment, but it ended up not being an issue (just make sure to close the curtains when you need to). It also can get a little noisy, but my sleep wasn't very disturbed. Overall, a tremendous value for apartment quality and location."
15400,99131049,03-09-2016,59200541,Natalia Sol,"It was a very nice stay. The apartment is exactly as described and has everything you could possibly need. We didn't get to meet Philippa but we could communicate and arrange everything for our arrival and departure. The  shower pressure was really good, we had lots of towels and the kitchen was more than fully equiped. There's a supermarket just around the corner which is great. The street is a bit noisy sometimes early in the morning. We would definitely choose this apartment again if we visited London."
15400,101139155,12-09-2016,18263861,Sharlane,"You MUST stay here! I cannot recommend this place enough. Communication with Philippa before we arrived was great, and the instructions to get into the flat were simple and clear. After we arrived, we received a welcome e-mail from her, and although she was not in London at the time, we were able to reach out to her neighbour if we needed anything (which we did not). The flat had everything we needed, and was the perfect size for a couple. It was on the ground floor, which was a bit nerve-wracking at first, but we were able to close the curtains and felt very safe and secure in the building. <br/><br/>Chelsea is a very posh area and we felt very safe, even when coming home at 1AM in the morning one night. It is close to so many restaurants, great shopping, and is a 10 minute walk from the tube. It was also a great home base for sightseeing - we frequently only had to take one line (Circle/District) to get where we needed to go. <br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again."
15400,101988349,16-09-2016,91648685,Mike,"A wonderful find, just off the King's Road. Compact but with everything that you possibly want and more. What's more, the host kept in touch to the extent that she was mid Atlantic when she became aware of the heat wave we were enjoying and e-mailed me to remind me of the air conditioning unit. Service indeed. Would I stay there again? Yes! Would I recommend it to friends? Ofcourse!"
15400,107551873,10-10-2016,36253984,Carmel,"We knew the area well, so knew how convenient the location is. Everything at your fingertips. <br/>There was a bit of noise during the day with local construction, but we were out most of the day so it wasn't an issue. The flat is small but cute, and had everything you would need. Highly recommend. "
15400,108051657,14-10-2016,92858307,Mary Lou,"What a great location! Super convenient, clean with a comfortable bed, luxurious linens and a super host. Our only regret is that we didn't get to meet Philippa as she was traveling- but she has a great system for check-in when she is traveling. We felt safe in the neighborhood and found a great breakfast place a few steps away... Nells. Tell them ""San Diego"" sent you!!"

15400,109863197,23-10-2016,35019564,Laurent Et Stéphanie,"Un superbe séjour : l'appartement est idéalement situé car  les bus passants à l'arrêt situé à quelques mètres desservent la station de métro de Sloan Square mais ont aussi un accès direct et rapide à Picadilly Circus, Victoria Station et bien d'autres lieux stratégiques. La station de métro Sloan Square étant sur la circle line est très pratique. King's Road est une rue commerçante animée, on peut manger dans des restos très sympas dans les environs proches. Le quartier chic est vraiment idéal.<br/>L'appartement est très agréable, très coquet, la déco est jolie et la propreté est absolument impeccable. Philippa s'est montrée très réactive et prévenante dans ses messages, ainsi que de bons conseils. Elle ne nous a pas reçus à l'arrivée mais les explications étaient suffisantes pour que nous puissions nous installer confortablement. Une gentille attention nous attendait dans l'appartement. Tout a été vraiment parfait hormis un peu bruit la nuit et au petit matin (plaque de fer sur laquelle roulent les voitures à cause de travaux, service de livraison du magasin Habitat juste à coté, camions poubelles) dus au fait qu'on se situait au rdc, qui nous ont parfois réveillés. Néanmoins j'y retournerais avec plaisir et recommande grandement cet appartement. Merci Philippa. "

15400,202250528,10-10-2017,22027723,Timothy,We enjoyed every bit of our stay at Philippa's apartment. The location affords quick access to public transportation with a bus stop around the corner and the underground a short walk away. The apartment was cozy and warm for our stay in October. Philippa was easy to communicate with before and during our stay and left us with plenty of instructions and tips. We would stay here and highly recommend!
15400,239862634,03-03-2018,16945938,Inna,"This is a perfect flat for exploring London. Cosy, clean, close to the tube station, with many places for a substantial breakfast or a quick pint. Philippa is a super friendly and hospitable host. Out stay was great (including no problems with hot water which is not a rare thing in London and the heating inspite of the Beast from the East). A highly recommended place!"
15400,245006157,20-03-2018,158725324,Shelley,This was a great 1 bedroom flat with all the amenities of home. A short 8-10 minute walk to two tube stations as well as around the corner from the flat was a Waitrose market which has everything you need at great prices. The flat is located in a quiet area of Chelsea and a great place to come home to after sightseeing all day. I would stay here again in this Chelsea flat.
15400,248028439,30-03-2018,16702019,Robert,"Perfect stay! Excellent location with the bus stop within 30 sec, and the tube within a 10 min walk. Central but still very quite. Great and safe area. Very easy check in and very well equipped lovely apartment, clean. Thank you Philippa!"

15400,438249851,16-04-2019,89780620,栗子Elly,Philippa的房子在住宅区内，环境很好，非常的安静，房间内设施很齐全(吹风机，洗衣机，烘干机，烤箱，微波炉以及洗碗机等等)，房东回复消息也很及时很好沟通。房子在一楼，面积不太大但是采光很好，客厅2面都有窗户非常的通透，步行到最近的地铁站大约需要10分钟，但是步行到最近的公交车站只需2～3分钟，到China town坐公交车不用换乘半个小时就能到。房间内可以做饭，不过附近没有中超或者亚超，最近的超市是Waitrose。
15400,441942910,22-04-2019,138449721,Sarah,"We had a lovely and comfortable stay in Philippa’s flat. The location is great, we found several excellent restaurants nearby (favorites were Murials and the Ivy), and it’s a short walk to the Kensington Station. The flat is cozy and bright, it got a little warm with the windows closed but once you open a couple there are lovely breezes that cool it right down. The shower is amazing with fantastic water pressure! Philippa is very responsive to questions and never took more than a day to respond even while she is on her own vacation.  We traveled on our 1st anniversary and she left us a welcome card and an anniversary card also which was so sweet. Highly recommend!"
15400,448626017,05-05-2019,100840491,Tim,"As advertised, it is a great place to stay. This was my third visit and I hope to return next year."
15400,506158053,10-08-2019,80916737,Rebecca,This was a perfect place to stay for 10 days while sightseeing in London. It was a little larger than I anticipated and was quite comfortable for two. The location is excellent — close to several bus lines and lots to do within walking distance. The construction was not very disruptive since it took place mostly when we were awake and out of the house. Overall an excellent experience.

Состоит из небольшого коридора, спальни с кроватью шириной примерно 140-150 см. и объединённой гостиной с кухней, в обеих комнатах по два окна на разные стороны, они очень светлые. <br/>Автобусная остановка Chelsea Old Town Hall и большой супермаркет Waitrose, работающий с 7-30 до 22 часов, расположены в 5 минутах пешком. До станции метро прогулочным шагом минут 15. В 10 минутах пешком к центру на Кинг Роуд есть недорогие  места, чтобы перекусить - Pret A Manger и Itsu, да и вся улица представляет собой сплошные магазинчики. <br/>В квартире есть все, что может потребоваться во время проживания, включая посуду и кухонную утварь для приготовления различных блюд. Приятно, что есть капсульная кофемашина Нескафе Дольче Густо и тостер.<br/>Wi-fi есть, работает нормально, также есть Нетфликс со всевозможными фильмами, мультфильмами и передачами (на английском, разумеется). <br/>Хозяйка, Филиппа, отвечает на любые вопросы через связь на сайте очень любезно, оперативно и подробно. <br/>Непосредственно рядом с домом идёт реконструкция здания, работы начинаются примерно с 7-30 в будни, заканчиваются достаточно рано, в выходные не работают. Мы в это время встаём, нам шум от стройки не мешал, но для кого-то может быть важно."

15400,619062614,16-03-2020,94988736,Michael & Julie,The location is excellent.  Shops and cafes  a block away. The flat is located in a quiet building on a quiet street.  There is construction going on next door but it did not bother us. It was very comfortable and a relaxing place to return at the end of a long day.  We would definitely stay again.

Phillippa의 성격이 저와 잘 맞다고 생각합니다. 주변에 갈 수 있는 상점, 레스토랑, 박물관, 백화점 모두 접근성이 좋은 반면, 조용한 주택가에 있어서 집에서 휴식할 때에도 좋았습니다. 가까운 지하철역은 15분 이내인데 체감상 조금 멀다는 느낌이 있었지만 버스는 매우 가까워서 편리합니다. 무엇보다 ‘wait rose’가 가까워서 최고입니다! 런던 교통상황을 잘 몰라서, 늦은 체크인에도 기다려주고, 친절하게 안내해주어서 감사드립니다. 다음에 또 방문하고 싶습니다. 건강하게 잘 지내시길!"

Less than a 5 minute walk to Warren Street Tube Station, and buses to Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross/Trafalgar Square, King's Cross/St. Pancras.<br/>Clean, safe neighborhood with restaurants and pubs steps away.<br/>A Tesco, Sainsbury and Pret a Manger are really close. 3 bds and 2 bthrm were enough to comfortably house 6 adults. Full kitchen, dish washer, and washing machine were a plus. No complaints. Would stay here again. Thanks Liz."

17402,593645,03-10-2011,1149659,Barry And Michelle,"The apartment was very clean, easy to use and was a great temporary home for us.  We stayed here for 9 days as we did some day trips out to various other cities across the UK.  The location is absolutely fabulous.  It is within walking distance of at least 5 different tube lines and two national rail stations, so day trips are super easy.  There are a host of restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, etc. in easy walking distance.  I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!"
17402,648636,20-10-2011,562216,Michael,"Liz was really great to accomodate our need for an apt. only ONE day before we were leaving for London.<br/><br/>The apt. is very cute.  Liz left really detailed information about the apt. and was available in case we needed anything.<br/><br/>We love the neighborhood (walking distance to Soho/West End) and it was perfect for our needs."

17402,1964976,13-08-2012,1447834,Wendy,"The apartment was in a great central location for the Olympics and very close to the underground and restaurants.  It was a clean (except for some silver fish in one of the bathrooms) and comfortable apartment.  I was not happy with the number of bathroom towels provided.  There were 5 of us so we were given 5 bath towels, 2 hand towels and no wash clothes.  We were there for 9 days and the washing machine broke early in our stay.  Our towels got a little ripe by the end or our stay. <br/><br/>Liz was responsive when we emailed her, but I would have liked better communication on confirming our stay as it got closer.  We paid for the flat 6 months in advance because it was for the Olympics so I started to get worried when I did not hear from her.  I finally emailed her just over a week before we were to arrive to confirm our stay and find out how we were to access the flat.  When she responded, she confirmed the place but said nothing about accessing it.  Finally a day before we were to arrive she emailed the access info. <br/><br/>Lastly, The second day we were there the washing/dryer machine jammed and would not open.  Liz sent someone out to fix it and told us it was a broken handle, but didn't let us know it wouldn't be fixed until after we were gone.  We found this out only after sending an inquiring email.  She never once talked with us about paying for the repair.  When we got home we received an email from an Airbnb mediator to pay for the repair.   Through Airbnb we came to a compromise and paid half of the repair though we did not break the handle.  Liz is responsive and nice, but often does not initiate communication when it would be appropriate and helpful.  "
17402,2463153,01-10-2012,2874775,Phil,"Overall, the stay here was pleasant and met all our needs for our time in London.  <br/><br/>Pros: <br/>Location is close to several tube stations making it easy to get around the city.<br/>Lots of space where you can really spread out, bright with lots of windows.<br/>Numerous restaurants and pubs nearby to get something to eat or drink.<br/>Close to several grocery and pharmacy.<br/>Liz provided a nice welcome guide with recommendations. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>Several baby silverfish in the bathrooms.<br/>Front bedroom facing the street can be very noisy at night with pub patrons on their way home. (back two bedrooms were quiet).<br/>Keys and check in details were sufficient without a problem, but not provided until the day prior."
17402,7478022,22-09-2013,6142699,Peter,"idealer Platz um in London Urlaub zu machen,<br/>alles ist vom Appartement zu Fuss zu erreichen,<br/>die Ausstattung des Apartments ist sehr gut, es ist sauber und hat viel Platz, die Gastgeber sind sehr nett und immer ansprechbar wenn es Probleme gibt. Sehr zu empfehlen."
17402,8335532,26-10-2013,6223326,Ratko,"Great and clean place if you need a central location in London. Great if you have couples (2 queen beds), and big and equiped kitchen. Nice place if you enjoy restaurants and pubs in central London.<br/><br/>Jack and Liz were great hosts - everything work perfectly."
17402,8688384,12-11-2013,8926815,Nat,"A cozy and lovely flat in a great location. No surprises from the posting, and the owner was very responsive with questions or needs."
17402,10523344,23-02-2014,12085881,Marta,"I went with five more friends to Liz's apartment in Fitzroy Street. Surely, the best apartment i have ever been to. Firstly, Liz couldn't have been nicer to us!The flat was even better that in the pictures. Everything was great, (two bathrooms and 3 bedrooms). Location couldn't have been better. Everything was within walking distance(british museum, candem town, oxford circuss, pica dilly) or you could get the Warren Street Tube and you arrived everywhere in less than five minutes. The house was very near to Tesco Express and Salsbury Supermarkets, Pharmacies and everything you could ever head. Furthermore, the best night clubs in London (Libertine, Maddox and Cirque du Soire) were all a 15 minute walk. We stayed four days and we didn't have to pick any taxi!. The great majority of the Buses stopped in Tottenham Court Row(less than 3 minute walk from the house). <br/>I definitely recommend this house, as when we arrived, it couldn't be more clean. There was a dishwasher, washing machine, iron...everything you could need.<br/>We didn't stay much on the flat as we went on a tourist trip, but it was extremely pleasant arriving to the flat,as it was great located and beds were extremely confortable.<br/>I wont regret staying again in Liz's apartment!"

The center of london is within walking distance.<br/>The apartment was clean, quiet and well-equipped. Only the noise in the street during the night was a little annoying.<br/>Liz is very attentive to her guests.<br/>I definitely recommend this apartment.<br/>"

17402,25687272,23-01-2015,23242286,Cam,"The flat is well located, a short walk to two tubes stations (Victoria line and Northern line). There is good informational material sent in advance to help with arrival, and good reference material in the flat.<br/>One downside of being well located is that the flat tends to be very noisy at night. Directly across the street is a 140 room LSE student residence, and with a student pub on the street corner, there is a lot of activity directly below the flat between the pub and the residence. We stayed for seven nights, and basically every night was very noisy until late.<br/>This three bedroom flat would be a decent place to stay for the money except for one thing - two of the three beds have extremely poor quality mattresses. Before renting the flat, I specifically asked Liz about the mattress quality, and she assured me that the mattresses were of good quality. Well this was unfortunately for me and my family a blatant misrepresentation. One bed has a decent double mattress. The other two beds have really really bad mattresses, the kind where the springs are to the surface and little or no support or padding. To make matters worse, one of the beds has broken slats, so you sort of ooze downward in the middle. I reported this after our first (sleepless) night, and Liz's partner Jack came over to the flat. I showed him the two bad mattresses, and he seemed surprised at how bad they were, said he agreed that they were not of acceptable quality, and that he'd try to get them replaced immediately, but given it was a Saturday he said in all likelihood we wouldn't get new mattresses delivered until Monday. I said that was ok, and I appreciated his honesty about how bad the mattresses were, and his willingness to deal with the situation. Well, on Monday no mattresses arrived, nor any message from Jack or Liz about a change of plans. After two of my emails went unanswered, Liz finally answered to say that the existing mattresses were actually fine (!), that she's slept in the flat many times and that she's never had complaints before!!!! She didn't bother explaining how Jack could have been so wrong in his assessment. She had the nerve to tell me ""different beds suit different people I guess"". If the two mattresses were not of throw-away quality, why would Jack suggest replacing them immediately if they were not crappy?? The reason i'm making a big deal of this, as I've told Liz, is that the ONLY question I had of Liz before renting the flat was whether the mattresses were of decent quality.  She misrepresented the facts, and then despite her partner Jack agreeing with me, she would not admit she had lied to me. So buyer beware of what Liz has to say! I would suggest looking elsewhere. "
17402,25855435,27-01-2015,22523302,Hasan,The apartment was lovely and in a perfect location near great places to eat and famous streets of London and landmarks as well so its great for exploring the city. The hosts were so helpful and even made sure to fix the lights in the living room that were damaged by a previous guest before we even got there. They also provided a helpful info pack about London which was great for exploring. I would definitely recommend the apartment and the hosts to other people and hope I can use the apartment again another time.

Liz is very responsive and helpful in answering all my questions and giving all the informations I need to know, especially for check in and check out. We love the location, very close to restaurants and groceries as well as the tube station. All can be reached by walking distance in a couple blocks aways. The apartment is very clean and new, just as shown in pictures in airbnb. Check in and check out were super easy. Liz sent me the instructions for both in advance. The only one reason is just the water is very long to get warm and low water pressure in shower. Aside from that the apartment is just perfect. Thank you again Liz for having us and being a great host. We can’t wait to go back London and stay at your place again."

There are three underground stations within 8 mins walk, which is very convenient. The apartment is located in the shadows of the BT Tower and in the stomping grounds of the College of London. I highly recommend the apartment, but if you are looking for a quaint neighborhood, you might look elsewhere. Good value."
17402,321762934,11-09-2018,123823749,Sherrie,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was very clean and had the perfect amount of space for our party of four adults. The showers had great water pressure and the linens were very nice. One of the best features was it’s central location, just a short walk to multiple tube stations. That made it easy to pop back in later in the evening to recharge phones, grab coats, etc. The building was quiet and got great light. Overall, a really great experience. The only thing we would change is how you get the keys to the place. It’s a little confusing, especially after a long day of travel. On the plus side, Liz was very helpful and answered our call immediately when we needed assistance retrieving the keys. We highly recommend and would stay here again."

All required amenities including public transport/groceries/entertainment/leisure are at door step almost.<br/>Entire flat was really clean and nice but  out of 3 bed room, 1 is relatively smaller. The host Liz was very professional and provided all possible information well on time.<br/>Only miss was laundry and maid services for daily cleaning was not there and we were asked to pay if we choose. If you are planning to stay for more than a day then pls be ready to keep house clean and before leaving also it was clearly instructed that flat needs to be handover in the aame condition. Which sometimes practically not possible as travellers are in hurry to checkout mostly.<br/>Overall place was really peaceful and I would recommend for family stay anytime. Just compare the cost while booking.<br/>Cheers!!<br/>Vikash Anand<br/>Mumbai, India"

The flat is in the perfect area -- just a few short blocks from the underground and walkable to plenty of neighborhoods for sightseeing or pub-hopping.  Liz was incredibly easy to get into contact with, and was super helpful with any questions we had. She sent over a whole packet of information about the apartment, how to get there, things to do, and places to go, which was really helpful! The apartment was very clean, (my biggest fear when traveling, always), and the bedrooms were pristine, though there was a slight smell of mildew in the en suite bathroom. Overall, I would absolutely stay here again!"

17402,6.00597E+17,08-04-2022,1943948,Kristoph,"When I travel and stay in Airbnb, there are a few key things I look for:<br/>1. Is the place in a central location so it is easy to get around?<br/>2. Is it quiet so I’ll be able to sleep?<br/>3. Are there places in the immediate area to grab food, etc.<br/>Liz’s place was great for me and my 2 other travelers. Two bedrooms are in the back (totally quiet) and one on the street which I found very quiet as well (minimal to zero car noise, etc). There are 2 tube stops (Goodge and Warren Street) that are in the area to explore London. There are also several places to buy food, restaurants and pubs you can walk to - but all tucked a block or two away so the apartment itself is quiet. The building itself is also quiet as I never heard or saw the other tenants. My friend in one of the back bedrooms commented on how sound proof the walls seemed to be within the apartment itself as he never heard us wake up and get going each morning.<br/>While check in is not a lock box, it still was easy as you go pick up the keys from a small grocery market very close by when it’s time for check-in. Very easy.<br/>Liz continued to make sure all was okay throughout the trip. If you have a need for a 3 bedroom/2 bath apartment in London, I highly recommend."

The area is so much cleaner and greener than 30 years ago when I was a student nurse nearby. Great street food and restaurants with a huge range of internationals foods,  some good beer available in the pubs and a short walk to the British Museum, a good bookshop near UCL, other shops and the theatres."

17402,1.03545E+18,29-11-2023,1983147,Jason,"My family and I had a great stay at Liz's place. The location was excellent: there are tons of things to do and places to see within walking distance, and nearly all of London's attractions are no more than a short Tube ride away. The place was as described and fit our family (two parents, one grandmom, two kids) perfectly. Finally, Liz was communicative and responsive throughout. I would stay here again and recommend it unequivocally."
24328,139412,15-11-2010,275656,Christopher,"The communication with Joe was very easy. We received accurate direction upon arrival and Joe made us feel welcome before we met. <br/><br/>We stayed for three nights and we would definitely come again.<br/>The location is easy to reach via TFL and the area offers a different view from the other side of the river Thames. We even managed to go for a run in Battersea Park. Great!<br/>The two owners are very nice and make you feel very welcome. The beautiful house with its stylish and well chosen interior gives a warm comfort.<br/><br/>We can really recommend this place. It is a very good alternative to main stream locations and it instantly becomes your little home in this amazing city."
24328,165288,04-01-2011,108257,Branka,"We loved staying in Joe Chen's house. It's very comfortable, well organized, stylish and clean and we felt at home from the very first day. Joe and Paolo are lovely hosts who did everything to make us feel welcome. Battersea Park close by was so beautiful! Ideal for long walks. We would love to stay at theirs again! <br/><br/><br/>"
24328,221644,10-04-2011,315279,Craig,The host canceled my reservation 38 days before arrival.
24328,684480,01-11-2011,1232727,Marc,"Excellent contact avec Joe qui répond très vite et qui est très agréable. Belle maison mitoyenne très propre et bien décorée. Joe nous accueille vraiment chez lui.<br/>Séjour à quatre très sympa avec même une piscine et sauna en traversant la route !<br/>Seul tout petit bémol, battersea n'est pas sur une ligne de métro. Il faut compter 15/20 mn pour rejoindre Victoria ou South Kensington en bus ou en taxi."
24328,758063,01-12-2011,1390252,Ann,"Joe's placde in Battersea is fabulous.  Dealing with Joe was delightul; he was very helpful and accommodating and very accessible and easy to communicate with.  His house is very comfortable, he left very thorough and informative instructions and information.  Without ever meeting him, he made me feel right at home.  I highly recommend his house to anyone looking for a home away from home.  His well supplied kitchen makes it easy to prepare your own meals.  For those wanting to go out to eat, there are many wonderful restaurants within walking distances.  A short bus ride from King's Road or the underground, makes it an ideal location. We had a great time in London thanks to Joe."
24328,842102,06-01-2012,1392972,Claudia,"We had a great stay in this house, well located in Battersea, perfectly served by several bus lines, with a very short trip to reach Sloane Square, South Kensington or Victoria Station. The house is warm and pleasant, full of art pieces and smartly furnished, with a beautiful kitchen perfectly equipped. We were two adults with two boys and one 2-years-old child, it was very confortable for us. We hadn’t the opportunity to meet the owner but we received by him all the information we needed in a very complete, effective and friendly way. "
24328,889427,29-01-2012,94073,Gerard,"Beautiful, clean house in a super location.  Joe was very helpful.  Great trip.  Will stay again!"
24328,1127027,14-04-2012,303322,Grace,"My Aussie family was in London for my sister's wedding and found a second home at Joe and Pablo's house. The house was perfect for recovering from long journeys and catching up.<br/><br/>We loved the details of the house - architectural features, glass floors and many paintings, as well as cooking up a storm in the well equipped kitchen. The common garden was idyllic. Overall, we felt very lucky to be able to stay at Joe and Pablo’s house.<br/><br/>The house is in a great location. Given the amount of space and proximity to Piccadilly tube line - its a great deal. A zipcar is also just around the corner, which we made use of during our stay. "
24328,1162704,22-04-2012,1765115,Paola,"We 3 stayed as a familiy for 8 days at Joe's home. The house is very clean and functional, instructions clear and complete. Good location and connections. I loved the aesthetic sensibility of their interior design. Ability in combining  elements with dfferent caracter and history, art all over the place creates a subtile tension, vibrant, inspiring and multicultural at the same time. We felt at home. Joe let us discover places we loved and would not have discovered ourselves. We felt a bit like locals. thks will come again!<br/><br/> "
24328,1215202,02-05-2012,1552571,Beth,"Joe's home is beautiful and very well equiped.  Angelina was there at the agreed time and assisted with a query during our stay, immediately and very professionally.  The bed in the main bedroon is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. it took us a while to get orientated regarding public transport in the area, but bus 319 to Sloan Square is a win.  It was a great experience.  Thank you Joe."
24328,1251695,09-05-2012,375027,Ella,"We really enjoyed our stay in Joe's flat in Battersea. The location is very good. Easy buses just outside into central London (including late-night), and only a 20 minute walk to Clapham Junction with connections to everywhere. The flat is so so lovely - really well designed, beautiful light, we were very impressed with the layout. The two bedrooms are far away from each other to provide good privacy. There is some adult-only artwork in the flat, which struck us as a bit odd for an airbnb property. Also, there is some major construction going on next door which woke us up some mornings.<br/><br/>Overall, very happy with Joe's flat"
24328,1565130,26-06-2012,1602433,Ana,"Wonderful house, nice place and tidy with reliable owners. Joe and Paul cared all things we needed. Good accessibility having regard to the price.<br/>recommend. (group of 6 university teachers)"
24328,1721763,16-07-2012,2308712,Lorna,"We were very happy to have been able to stay at Joe's home during our recent visit to London.  The house is exactly as it appears in the photos.  The decor is amazing with fantastic touches everywhere!  The kitchen is extremely well-equipped, rooms are all of a good size & the beds are very comfortable - linens exceptional!!!  Through the back door is a large communal green area that can only be accessed by the residents of the homes that back onto it.  It's lovely and lush and because this house is the end terrace unit, the patio still has a feeling of privacy - very nice!  The home is full of wonderful art and and you must really take the time to notice all the little details - delightful surprises abound.  We cannot recommend this property highly enough.  We loved it all!  Thank you Joe.    "
24328,1846843,31-07-2012,1541167,Desirae,Amazing! I felt at home as soon as I walked through the door. The bus stop is really close by so transportation was a breeze. The kitchen is wonderful and I have to ask him where he got the matress and pillows because they were beyond comfortable. I would say everyone should stay here. When I go back to London there is no place I'd rather be. 
24328,1921606,08-08-2012,1583772,LeighAnna,Very well-kept flat with nice communal back garden.  
24328,2386563,23-09-2012,3547865,Michael,"What a pleasant house in a very convenient location! The stay was most enjoyable and the house was immaculate, well designed and full of interesting artwork and literature. I highly recommend!"
24328,2663695,20-10-2012,3515890,Renee,"It really is as awesome as the pictures! The house is amazing – beautiful, great light, spacious and clean. The artwork and wonderfully decorated interior make it comfortable and inspiring. The location is perfect with a nice Italian coffee shop around the corner and close to public transportation making it easy to get around. <br/><br/>Joe is an excellent host as he is extremely friendly, helpful and a great communicator! He provided a thoughtful printed guide to the flat. His wonderful recommendations and tips helped us as we adjusted to London. <br/><br/>We loved every minute of our stay and would recommend Joe’s place. It exceeded all expectations."
24328,5414713,29-06-2013,6068667,Michelle,"My four friends and I rented this house for over a week and it was absolutely perfect for our first time in London.  The location is very good (a little out of the city), and we had no issues at all getting into London and even to attractions outside of London via bus, subway and taxi.  The house itself is wonderful- very clean and stocked with all the essentials (plenty of clean towels, kitchenware, etc).  The decor is very fun and fresh, we instantly felt very much at home.  Joe is an excellent communicator.  He responds quickly and provided us with detailed and comprehensive guides for the house and the local neighborhood.  I would definitely recommend Joe to my friends and other Airbnb users! "
24328,5544127,05-07-2013,606793,Mihai,"We had a very pleasant stay at Joe's house. It has an excellent location, 2 minutes walk to the bus stop and 15 minutes to the subway station, close to many restaurants and pubs. The house is very clean, spacious and comfortable, has a fully equipped kitchen, a charming backyard and is artistically vibrant decorated.We got great advice from Joe regarding public transportation connections and the neighborhood.  Overall, our London vacation was even more enjoyable thanks to this house and its owner."
24328,8054627,14-10-2013,4691383,Daan,"Nice, modern house with charming private communal court/garden in typical London neighbourhood. Tasteful and well-equipped. You can see the owner loves his house and right he is.    "
24328,8237481,21-10-2013,9379995,Niels,"My family and I had a great week in Joe's house, which is situated in a quiet neighborhood, 2 min. walk from bus transport and 15 min to the nearest over ground station (Clapham Junction). If you enjoy jogging or a walk in the park, Battersea park is only 5 minutes jog away (a 5 km round trip). I never met Joe in person, but he was very informative and helpful in the booking process and the detailed informative instruction for the house that he emailed.                 "
24328,8352553,27-10-2013,9170295,Catherine,"Nous avons séjourné 5 nuits chez Joe et avons beaucoup apprécié sa maison, très propre, pratique, confortable et joliment décorée. Le jardin commun à l'arrière de la maison est particulièrement agréable. La maison est tout à fait conforme aux photos mises sur le site. L'endroit est un peu excentré mais les liaisons en bus sont rapides (15 à 20 mn pour rejoindre Victoria station)."
24328,8384941,28-10-2013,611915,Ruth,"A great house, comfortable stay, excellent communication with the host.  It was easy to access the property.  It was in a really good location.  The house was clean and had everything you could need.  Thanks for a great stay!"
24328,8714831,13-11-2013,8889603,Ezio,"Dear Joe<br/>Just a quick note to thank you for the hospitality. The house is beautiful and very well kept. We hope to be back soon. We will contact you through airbnb.<br/>Thank you again and kind regards."
24328,9451546,29-12-2013,10509119,Thomas,"Joe's communication and instructions were excellent! We found accessing the flat and all its amenities very easy and straightforward. The flat itself is modern, well equipped, very clean and comfortable. <br/><br/>I slept on the sleeper couch which was fairly comfortable, although obviously not as comfortable as a bed, but this offers great flexibility in addition to the two bedrooms. <br/><br/>The area itself is quiet and residential. There are a few small supermarkets close by (we used the Spar) and a large ASDA about a 15-20 minute walk or so away. There are also a few nice pubs around. Our favourite for food was the Prince Albert.<br/><br/>The area is well connected with buses, but no tube close by. The 44 gets you into Victoria pretty quickly though, which worked for us, as we were doing some sight seeing. Battersy Park and the Thames are also really close by.<br/><br/>There were no major cons for us really. There are a stairs up to both bedrooms and the bathroom, so not accessible for anyone who has a problem with stairs and things. For families with small kids, some of the art might not be appropriate, but we didn't have any problems with this.<br/><br/>Thanks for a great stay Joe!<br/>"
24328,9544658,02-01-2014,9465169,Alfonso,"Beautiful and warm house, in a good location. Easy to reach South Kensington by bus, and any other Central London location such as Victoria, Parlament, etc... Even walking to Victoria is a pleasant walk. Buses, shops near by, a couple of coffee shops and nice pub too within 5 minutes of walk. And for those looking for misteries a good fortune-teller is in the area (Charity shop).<br/>The house has a wow factor, with a very good decoration and distribution. We had a wonderful family holiday and reunion to celebrate the new year. Back garden is great (probably I should try again during summer). Overall fantastic, and Joe is really helpful too."
24328,11009539,17-03-2014,10053549,Kayla,"Nothing but great things to say.  We had a full house of friends and family, and this was perfect for the six of us.  The house is filled with windows and mirrors, keeping things light, the kitchen has everything you need, and we all enjoyed the fun decor and beautiful yard (we were spoiled with some summer-like weather in March). Absolutely recommend this flat.  While it's always nice to be walking distance from a tube station (which this is not), the bus lines take you anywhere you want to go quickly and easily (including to Vauxhall or Gloucester Rd tube stations), and there are many trains from Clapham.  In Battersea, within a 5-10 min walk, you have the park as well as quite a few restaurants/bakeries/bars/pubs. <br/>Joe worked with me to make the dates work, and check in and check out were very easy. Again, great stay."
24328,11884967,18-04-2014,10960724,Ghalia,"Great location, beautiful decor, super clean, friendly neighbors and a very professional owner.<br/>I highly recommend Joe's place "
24328,12059866,22-04-2014,1832540,Jacob & Tanja,We had a great stay en Joe's very nice apt. Which is very perfect for groups travelling. The communication was great and quick! Thanks for a great stay! We will recommend to use the city bikes located next to the fitness center for a tour around in london and to all the highlights! 
24328,12533098,05-05-2014,5557869,Catalina,"Beautiful house, beautiful location! We had the perfect stay at joes house. We loved everything. The connection to the city of London is great and battersea is beautiful too. Thanks for this wonderful stay and your house!! "
24328,13079613,19-05-2014,13828346,Lynn,The Artists house was just delightful!  It was unique and had everything you could wish for!  I would highly recommend this accommodation and Joe made life very easy for us with his superb communication and instruction.  We had a fabulous stay and even the sun shone!
24328,13533195,30-05-2014,11968770,Virve,"Joe was very kind and helpful and without delay replied to all our emails. The area was fantastic and the location is very good since there are many buses to the city from the nearby bus stop. The house was very charming,artistic and extra clean! The full-equipped kitchen was a pleasure. The beds were the most comfortable we`ve ever slept on. The steep flight of stairs was a bit of a challenge. We definitely will return and without hesitation can recommend Joe`s beautiful house to all our friends."
24328,13844635,06-06-2014,5810458,Jan,Joe was a great host and we loved the house! Joe was very responsive and accommodating. The house was very comfortable with lots of natural light and a well stocked kitchen.  A very nice place from which to explore a great city! 
24328,13971470,09-06-2014,6930514,Hugues,The house is a perfect place for a trip in London. I have not met our host but he was easily available by email.<br/>I would recommend it.
24328,18935099,03-09-2014,11741346,Simon,"Joe was a great host, provided very organized information regarding check-in and how all the bits in the house worked. The place is very comfortable, with a great communal garden in the back. Battersea Park is 5 minutes walk, Clapham Junction is 12 minutes walk, and there are plenty of buses going most places in London you would want to get to. Another great feature is having the Latchmere Leisure Centre across the road, which has a huge wave pool (our 2 year old son loved it), and the small Latchmere Playground is 1 minute walk.<br/><br/>The kitchen is well-stocked for cooking, and the beds are very comfortable (2 things which are sometimes overlooked with AirBnB places).<br/><br/>Dishwasher and laundry machine both work perfectly, but there is no microwave oven (which is sometimes easier than using the stove to reheat leftovers)."
24328,19237134,08-09-2014,10883154,Monica,"We have very much enjoyed Joe and Paolo's house. Well located and beautifully designed - our kids loved the portion of glass floor in the bedroom overlooking the kitchen - very clean, tidy and well stocked. Beds were also very comfortable. Joe, although being abroad while we were at his house, has always been very responsive and extremely helpful. We would definitely recommend the ""Artist House"" to everyone who is looking for a home from home accommodation. "
24328,19750665,17-09-2014,20929572,Tony,"I stayed at Joe's from 12 till 17 Sept. Everything was great. Joe is so talanted and the atmosphere in flat indicates that. Cleanliness and order are everywhere, lots of light and spacious garden. Thanks for everything and thanks Angelika for warm welcome."
24328,19954602,21-09-2014,20546320,Theophile,"Joe is a terrific host! He provides absolutely all the information you could possibly need, his house is amazing and well located in south London with a nice garden. Rooms are big and confortable, kitchen couldn't be better equipped and the entire place is designed with a perfect taste! I definitely recommend this place!"
24328,20954300,08-10-2014,20136380,Gerri,"Arrived to find the house open, and everything ready for us."
24328,21136169,12-10-2014,11121035,Cathrin,"The place is wonderful if not magnificent! We had a great time at Joe's wonderful house in the middle of an beautiful and quiet neighborhood. The house is cozy and thoughtful decorated, we had enough space and the backyard is amazing. Joe is a lovely host very caring and paying lots of attention to the details. "
24328,21700209,22-10-2014,2424765,Veeranuj,Great place! Joe's house is nice and cozy with fully equipments. Area is quiet and safe. We love sharing peaceful backyard. Highly recommend.

24328,23298297,28-11-2014,20444383,Alasdair,"The house was well equipped and comfortable and it was great to have off street parking in such a central location. The location worked well for us as it was convenient for meeting lots of our friends who live nearby. It was also great for our toddler as we were able to take him swimming across the road and also to Battersea Park, a ten minute walk away."
24328,23657185,07-12-2014,24097551,Anna,Casa preciosa en un Barrio tranquilo. Todo muy bien indicado y facil. Estuvimos comodos. Muy recomendable.
24328,23850647,12-12-2014,23977640,Ted,Joe thank you so much. You have a beautiful home which I highly recommend. 
24328,24812602,03-01-2015,21455785,Catherine,"Joe's attention to detail was greatly appreciated. We loved the house and the location was perfect for us. The garden out back was lovely, the beds were comfortable and when we had a minor problem, Joe was immediately helpful even on Christmas Day and in another country!"
24328,27212013,28-02-2015,17863244,Laura,"Joe was communicative, straightforward and very helpful.  He is well organised too (with a printed info file).  I highly recommend his property, which is his home and not a rental house.  Firstly it was very clean, and this is important.  It was a spacious 2 bed with a study, comfortable, with lots of quirky art, well furnished and all that you could need.  It was well equipped from dishwasher tablets to teabags. The beds were superb, as mentioned by another reviewer. we could not get up in the morning.  The location is excellent for buses and I walked to Clapham junction overland too.  Battersea park is is conveniently local so we walked the dog every day. First air bnb experience for me and has given me a great impression."
24328,27920594,15-03-2015,25846200,Bridget,"Highly recommend Joe's warm and comfortable home. We stayed at Joe's house whilst we were trading at Battersea Affordable Art Fair and coming home to a cosy comfortable house felt so very good at the end of each day, so much better than a hotel. Joe was excellent with communication and very organised in the lead up to our arrival with arrangements. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we needed to cook our meals and the bedding was brilliant (feather pillow on my bed!). "
24328,29273798,06-04-2015,26998106,Javier,"Magnífico alojamiento. En nuestro caso, que somos cinco, creemos que es óptimo para familias que busquen relajarse y tener todos los servicios tras un día explorando la ciudad. <br/>Ubicado en una zona tranquila, segura y bien comunicada. Hay varias líneas de autobús al centro de Londres al lado de la urbanización. El supermercado más cercano está a unos diez minutos andando. Había unos columpios en un parque colindante de los que nuestros hijos disfrutaron muchísimo.<br/>Tal y como se aprecia en las fotos la vivienda es moderna, cómoda, bellamente decorada y muy acogedora, la hicimos nuestra con rapidez. Además estaba muy limpia y ordenada.<br/>Todo funcionó con sencillez y de acuerdo a lo explicado con impresionante precisión por Joe. Pese a que no llegamos a conocer a los anfitriones en persona se mostraron cordiales y atentos. La única vez que les consultamos algo vía email respondieron bien y con gran rapidez.<br/>Hemos quedado muy satisfechos y repetiríamos sin dudarlo."
24328,30129325,18-04-2015,27525710,Corinne,"Nous avons trouvé une maison très bien entretenue et décorée d'oeuvres d'artistes contemporaines très sympas. La cuisine est très bien équipée, spacieuse et donne sur un jardin commun très paisible.<br/>Le quartier, non loin de Battersea Park, est aussi très agréable : nombreux commerces, petits restaurants, et pubs. On rejoint les sites touristiques de Londres assez rapidement en bus, voire à pied quand on est plus courageux et mieux chaussé ! Chelsea est vraiment tout près, juste après avoir traversé l'Abert Bridge, qui est magnifiquement illuminé la nuit. <br/>Nous avons vraiment apprécié cette maison, son confort, sa déco, sa situation, et la prévenance et rapidité des réponses de Joe. La concierge est aussi une personne bien serviable.<br/>C'est une maison que nous conseillerons."
24328,30974432,30-04-2015,12453541,Benjamin,"Quelle maison! Merci Joe pour ce séjour très agréable à Londres. Le contraste entre l'extérieur d'une ancienne maison en brique  et une décoration contemporaine est très sympa. Il y a beaucoup de belles choses et d'objets à voir dans la maison ( mention spéciale aux chaises de cuisine). Nous avons grandement apprécié le parking attenant à la maison à seulement quelques minutes du centre de Londres, facilement accessible ensuite avec le bus. Nous sommes venus en famille avec nos deux filles qui se sont bien amusées dans la maison et notre chien qui a également beaucoup apprécié le très joli parc à quelques mètres de la maison. Tout était fait pour que nous nous sentions à l'aise. Joe a été prévenant et toujours à l'écoute. Merci encore. "
24328,31628724,08-05-2015,11646589,Olivier,La maison est magnifique et parfaitement équipée. Les propriétaires ont beaucoup de gout. Il fait bon vivre dans cette maison. Le quartier est agréable et on est rapidement au bord de la Tamise. Il est très bien desservi par les bus. Les resto recommandés par Joe sont excellents notamment l'italien et le vietnamien. Un petit bémol sur les avions qui passent certains jours au dessus mais il semble que ce soit le cas de nombreux londonien puisque le survol de la capitale semble autorisé contrairement à Paris.
24328,32347260,17-05-2015,25893896,Léonie,Thank you for having us to stay! The house is beautiful and we were very comfortable. Joe was very helpful with answering queries very quickly. It is a lovely neighbourhood with Battersea Park really nearby and lovely cafés around the corner.

We all agreed that we would definitely love to stay here again.<br/>Also very convenient for a local 24 hr taxi rank. All in all a quiet and peaceful neighbourhood. "

Joe was very helpful with answering queries very quickly. Thank you Joe!!<br/>지하철이 연계가 되지않았지만 버스를 타고 런던 시내를 구경하는것도 나쁘지 않았어요. 여유있게 집을 쓸수있어서 좋았고 다음에도 또 머무르고 싶은 집입니다^^
24328,34661425,10-06-2015,31818411,O,Excellent apartment with everything you might need. Joe responded immediately to every question we had. Would recommend

24328,35586394,20-06-2015,34488229,Hemant,"This was a great stay for my family. We rented the place with 3 boys. House has a play area outside, very spacious with close by recreation center and park.<br/>The house has artistic decoration but the boys were careful. Very close to major attractions in London. <br/>We loved it."
24328,36259844,27-06-2015,25042151,Michael,"This was a great experience.  The house was everything we expected.  The location worked well for us - close enough to central London to be accessible, while providing a quiet place to rest our heads at night.  Joe is a solid host. Our questions and requests were answered promptly and in full.  We were very happy indeed!"
24328,37150618,05-07-2015,31044689,Anne,We enjoyed our stay.   The apartment is well stocked and clean.   It was easy to communicate with Joe.  And he left great instructions for the modern house.   We found it easy to make bus and underground connections.  
24328,37584081,08-07-2015,31681856,Justin,Spacious flat for our family of six. Quite close to the city.  Joe had very organized instructions and was an excellent communicator. The kids really enjoyed the backyard garden in the evenings. 
24328,37942669,12-07-2015,17867916,Caitlin,Apartment was nice and clean and kitchen was well stocked. We used the bikes across the street almost everyday of our trip which worked out great. Eclectic decor but we didn't spend too much time in the flat anyway so it didn't really bother us. 
24328,39901042,27-07-2015,24445263,Yunjeong,The house was perfect for living. Garden was nice and bus stop was near here. If you want to experience real londoner this is right choice <br/>집은 머물기에좋았어요. 셜록홈즈 나온집처럼 삼층이여서 특이했구요 다만 계단 오르내리기 싫어하시면 불편하실수도 있을것같아요 런던 주민이된 기분이였어요 
24328,40482721,31-07-2015,37027453,Kirsty,"We had a great time in the artist residence during our week in London. The house was spotless, and close to where our friends live so despite no tube it was a convenient location with great instructions for closest bus route, and we also used a combination of uber and a rental car. <br/>Joe's amazing folder of instructions for the house guest really was out of this world! So detailed, amazing description with places to eat, what key for which door, public transport etc. His attention to detail is outstanding! <br/>Joe was really quick to respond to emails and great at chasing us up before arrival.<br/>As two adults and a child, 2, we were very happy. Unfortunately the stairs were particularly steep for our little boy so we always had to be on watch but that's fine - not Joe's fault. <br/>Every nook and cranny is decorated, it's quite something. Great kitchen, great appliances, fantastic wifi, and good hot water after you realise you have to turn it on upon arrival. The only downside would be not enough pillows on the bed as they are a bit thin for my liking, only one each. <br/>Highly recommend this place, would return."
24328,41192995,05-08-2015,25744625,Heidi,"Beautiful home!  We were 4 adults and this was a great place for us.  Each couple had their own room, the main floor was spacious, and the courtyard in the back was a bonus that we used often.  The only downfall was that in the early morning hours, airplanes fly over frequently.  We recommend earplugs!  <br/>It's about a 10 minute walk to Clapham Junction, and 12-15 minute walk to Northcote Road.  Joe was a very responsive host and in his absence provided contact info for someone else who could assist us as needed.  I would certainly recommend this home to others looking to explore London."
24328,44629654,28-08-2015,7134498,Ruby,"Joe's house is so nice. We all like the decoration so much. And location is good, it is quiet area, but very convenient to go to centre with good transport network. Also you have find everything you need in the house. .Joe is also very kind and being so helpful. Will book with him again if family come again. "
24328,45503328,03-09-2015,41473279,Ulrike,"This was our first Airbnb experience and all I can say is WOW!<br/>Joe's house is absolutely lovely - all those mirrors and artwork - and was perfect for our party of five. Everything was exactly as described. The beds and the sofa were comfortable, the kitchen well equipped.<br/>Joe's instructions were precise and his detailed info folder very helpful with tips and maps of places to eat, public transport, shops, etc. <br/>Another plus is the gated parking lot right next to the house.<br/>Joe is a very attentive host and prompty replied to our messages.<br/>I can highly recommend Joe's house for a stay in London and would definitely book it again."
24328,45765017,06-09-2015,28604469,Jeni,"This was my first Airbnb experience.  Joe's house is exactly as described... lovely with an eclectic mix of artwork and books on every available wall and shelf.  It is obviously very well cared for and everything one could need in a 'home from home'. The beds were very comfortable and the kitchen dining room well organised. For me and my family, having a secure parking slot was important as we came to stay for a wedding close by and had to come by car.  Having shops within easy walking distance was another plus factor. The area felt very safe and pleasant to walk around and although close to one of the main roads through London it was quiet at night.  I can thoroughly recommend Joe's house for a stay in London.  Joe is prompt and clear with responses to questions which helps enormously.  "
24328,46983959,14-09-2015,24595890,Mark,Joe's place is fantastic. I loved the modern art and the place is spacious. The location was perfect as I could use public transportation to get to anywhere. Joe went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. I highly recommend!
24328,47878782,21-09-2015,242950,Arnel,Joe is a fantastic host and his home catered to all our needs. Joe is communicative and friendly and has an amazing 3 level townhouse in a leafy part of London - great access to the centre via bus and some great cafe and restaurant options nearby. Was really grateful for Joe's extra tips and for letting me store my bags in the apartment after checkout. A superb host and a gem of an apartment in London. Highly recommended! 
24328,48057395,23-09-2015,23445457,Sally,"Amazing house and fantastic design.  Lovely place to stay with very comfortable beds. Nice pub around the corner. Very in-depth info pack sent to us. Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone. Host kept us up to date with the booking, and seemed very friendly."
24328,48375881,26-09-2015,4687132,Nick,"Great apartment, very clean and great service. Only downside was the location of subway stations. <br/><br/>Had a great time there. <br/><br/>"
24328,49098278,01-10-2015,34633009,Jay,"Our family spent 3.5 weeks travelling around Europe, staying in airbnb places, and found Joe's house at Battersea to be the most enjoyable out of all. The house was spotless, and roomy for our family of five. The house is not too far from all the action in London, and we would definitely recommend the house to others!"
24328,50352052,11-10-2015,21827878,Kate,"Had a lovely stay in Joe's battersea home. The communication before and during the stay was great. The house was lovely, spacious and well designed.<br/>Great area for local pubs and getting around London.<br/>Would definitely recommend staying."
24328,50802099,14-10-2015,21045363,Jerome,"Beautiful flat, full of diverse pieces of art, and cool furniture, which gives it a hip, artsy feel. Very close to Battersea Park and easy to get into Central London. Joe was easy to deal with and we enjoyed the full experience! Highly recommended. "
24328,51741188,24-10-2015,7048031,Michael,"We had a great stay at Joe's. The handy guide to the house and neighborhood was much appreciated, as were Joe's clear instructions for checking in while he was away. The house was comfortable and eclectic, full of personal character. It was an excellent temporary home from which to explore London - with a bit of planning, we had no trouble using public transportation to/from Battersea. We took in the neighborhood itself as well, enjoying dinner at a local pub, and a Sunday morning walk through nearby Battersea Park. In short, I'd certainly look into staying at Joe's again when I'm next in London."
24328,53448623,09-11-2015,29270232,Keira,"This was such a lovely house to stay in while in London for work. It was perfect with having off street parking and within walking distance of Battersea park. <br/>The house is exactly as Joe has described on listing, very clean and sophisticated. Lovely neighbourhood with great places to eat, highly recommend the Mexican on Battersea road. <br/>Bed rooms lovely with very comfy beds, Joe was very accommodating with providing coffee and wine on our arrival. Thank you for making our stay so lovely and comfortable. Would Highly recommend renting this house! "
24328,58515248,03-01-2016,27469859,Chris,"Having spent many a night in London, working and enjoying many events over the years staying in Hotels, I felt it was time for a change and experience what it would be like in a residential area.<br/>Battersea was an ideal choice with so many possible links to the rest of the city and with a good local infrastructure of Restaurants/ Pubs/Shops and Recreational Park .<br/>The whole experience was a breeze, Joe has a lovely contemporary home and communicated with us from the offset, ensuring that everything was to our liking as well as to him, after all this is his home and he made us feel welcome.<br/>We all enjoyed our stay and we were pleased that our dogs could be with us instead of them going into Kennels."
24328,61579456,06-02-2016,10615116,Joseph,"A charming, beautifully designed and maintained stylish home. Joe is easily reachable and responsive.  Had no trouble at all with anything.   All details in house manual were very clearly covered.  There is a housekeeper in the complex (which is part of an especially well maintained gated community), though I never met her and had no reason to seek assistance.  Did not have the opportunity to really explore the area, but found the most pleasant way to get to where I was working (Trafalgar Sq.) was to walk to Sloane Sq tube either over the Albert Bridge (soldiers must break step when crossing!) or through Battersea Park which is a lovely walk."
24328,67838108,31-03-2016,52527257,Martin,Joe was extremely attentive and charming. As we were staying for a long period he checked on our progress several times to ensure that we had found everything which we could need and were getting the best out of the area.He could not have been more accommodative and helpful.
24328,70212013,17-04-2016,49539445,Sarah,"I am on my way he from a perfect weekend in London where this property provided us with an excellent base. From the minute we made the booking Joe was incredibly helpful. Joe was happy to respond to questions. The property was clean, spacious and comfortable for 4 of us to spend the weekend. I have a feeling we will be back. "
24328,76639324,28-05-2016,12859567,Pollyanna,"Our second time at the Artists House what a brilliant house, brilliant location and welcoming host.  It is a warming, comforting and inspiring place.  Big thanks to Angelina for meeting us with the key and code.  Good quality beds and bedding.  All the extras you need in any home. Thank you so much, we thoroughly enjoyed relaxing in your home after very busy days working at the Chelsea Flower show. It was perfect. "
24328,86855777,17-07-2016,54082541,Julien,"It was a really nice week-end at Joe. The house is wonderfull. The proximity with Battersea Park and public transportation ( coach station and train station) was appreciated. And the local pub ""The Latchmere"" nearby made us like english food!!!"
24328,88185437,23-07-2016,60117646,Isabelle,Le logement correspond tout à fait à l'annonce. C'est une maison très agréable à vivre et très bien équipée. Très bien située pour visiter Londres. De nombreux bus à proximité. Le quartier aussi est très agréable. Les commerces sont proches.
24328,90550035,01-08-2016,42711665,Regis,Excellent home to discover London! Busses are really close and therefore everything is accessible. The house is absolutely perfect and fits for up to 6. The decoration is just ecstatic and the view on the garden is so nice in the morning... Just do it.
24328,91782841,06-08-2016,15681377,Pamela,"Fantastic house, really beautiful and homely, and Joe was a perfect host, making the check in/out process and the stay itself very straightforward.  I would recommend to anyone."
24328,93808011,14-08-2016,30007840,Richard,"What can I say about this house? It's fantastic! <br/>The interior was exceptional... perfectly thought out and very well designed,  the mezzanine floor was a particular plus point.  The way the interior was designed it made the house feel three times the size.  This was another major plus point as we didn't feel like we were treading on each others feet.  <br/>The house in general was very well stocked, we never felt like we were missing something as it was already there.  <br/>Joe was very easy to contact and very prompt in replying.  The housekeeper Angelina was very welcoming and made us feel right at home from the moment we walked into the house.  <br/>The location of the house was also very good,  we felt close enough to the center of London (it took about 20 minutes on the bus to get into central London) but far enough out to not feel like we were constantly in London.  The street the house is on is close to everything you'd ever need (shops, sports center, parks and transit links). <br/>All in all this house is a hidden gem!! All three of us would happily recommend this house to anyone.  It will be high on our list of places to stay when planning another London trip.  "
24328,98105564,29-08-2016,24818004,Pasta,"Joe was a fantastic host. Even though he wasn't able to meet us, he was able to sort out a logistical problem that we had with ease. the size of the house and the location were perfect for our needs. If I ever need to go to that part of London again, Joe's place will be the first place I look at staying.<br/><br/>Recommended."
24328,100166607,07-09-2016,2424765,Veeranuj,2nd time gere at Joe's place. Very helpful and easy to access host. House is fully equipments as we want. Safe and nice area. 5minutes walk to Battersea Park. Highly recommend

We were there for a month, and everything went smoothly from initial contact to final goodbye.<br/>Everything is better than described (for once....), check in and out was straightforward, and communication excellent. <br/>For us, it is the perfect spot to be, in London."
24328,6.06377E+17,16-04-2022,32204015,Bryony,Joes house is beautiful and in a excellent location. There are many parks to choose from and the communal garden is fantastic. Joe is really helpful and quick to respond. Would highly recommend

25123,35618,14-04-2010,64366,Adeline,"10,000 times better and cheaper than staying at a hotel! The house is immaculate, very spacious and very well decorated and all the furniture is brand new. It's very quiet outside so you can sleep soundly...Grace is a wonderful host who really makes sure your stay is comfortable and the best ever...and a wonderful cook too...her dishes are delicious! Location is perfect...5 min walk from huge 24 hrs Tesco, tube station 2 min walk, High Street 3 min walk and Brent Cross Shopping Mall is around 7 min walk."
25123,41216,09-05-2010,115343,Anna,"Grace's house is so clean! It's probably the cleanest I have ever seen. The room is super comfy and rather roomy. She's a great host.<br/><br/><br/>"
25123,42724,15-05-2010,124164,Adi,"Even though this review is late.. I would not miss giving it for the world.<br/><br/>Stuart and I were plannin gour move to London from Wales and looking for properties over one weekend, decided to look at airbnb.<br/><br/>True to the past reviews Grace has recieved, she is prompt in getting back in touch with you. In my case at 11.45pm so that we could be confirmed for the next evening.<br/><br/>She is a fantastic hostess with a home thats as warm as her. She welcomed us with open arms and an open heart and never made us feel like guests.<br/><br/>Grace was a pleasure... is every possible way. And I will recommend her hands down.<br/><br/>Anytime!!"
25123,45398,23-05-2010,123836,Phoebe,"Grace G is awesome, very courteous and friendly in person. She offers great hospitality which I appreciate. Her home is modern, well-maintained, clean and comfortable. The location is at a quiet and nice suburban neighborhood within walking distance to tube station. The house is equipped with WIFI internet, which is convenient to use with notebook. Besides fresh linen and towel, she also provides breakfast. The kitchen is stocked with grocery items which guests can help themselves with. Overall I have a pleasant stay."
25123,48174,31-05-2010,107553,Marian,"Grace G is a lovely, friendly and thoughtful<br/>person. Our room was quite adequate and overlooked the garden. The neighborhood is a very interesting mix of Hasidic Jews and Asians.<br/>Breakfast provisions were excellent-exotic yogurt flavors we cannot get in the U.S. Grace was kind enough to leave an umbrella at our door on a day that looked like it might rain and she served as our alarm clock one morning when we had to rise at 5:30AM. The closest tube is Brent Cross-a brisk 10 minute walk. We would highly recommend staying with Grace G.<br/>Marian & Russell"
25123,52972,14-06-2010,109432,Rick,"I'm so glad I decided to stay at Grace's place.  It's so comfortable, clean, and pretty.  Everything I needed was there.  The neighborhood is great and I had a wonderful time walking through it and seeing the local shops. Grocery stores and public transportation are very easy to get to. Grace herself is the perfect host, very generous and a gracious person.  I really hope I can meet Grace again and perhaps offer her the same hospitality she offered me.  Thank you so much Grace!!"
25123,53508,15-06-2010,109432,Rick,What can I say about Grace that isn't already said?  She's wonderful; I would definitely stay here again!
25123,54184,17-06-2010,80489,Mohd Rafie,"Grace's house is the first Airbnb experience for my girlfriend's parents. Thus, in the first place, I really hope it would be a wonderful experience - I am not glad the parents like the experience.<br/><br/>Moreover, the house is very clean, well-arranged and welcoming. Grace herself is very friendly, kind and respectful. I highly recommend this apartment to other travelers. "
25123,55418,20-06-2010,109432,Rick,"Grace is so kind, I decided the best idea was to just stay with her more nights!"
25123,56274,22-06-2010,109432,Rick,"Grace couldn't get rid of me!! I just kept adding days, but she was very gracious and accepted my requests to extend my visit.  Thank you!!"
25123,57178,25-06-2010,138206,Luca,"Simple, lovely place, short and easy walk from the underground, tucked away in a zone 3 residential area not distant from Golders Green and Hampstead Heath (a plus for runners). Grace is a wonderful and friendly host; your privacy is guaranteed but you will find her for a nice chat if you wish to. Thanks again! I really enjoyed it."
25123,58510,28-06-2010,80489,Mohd Rafie,"We made a come-back and nothing I wish to add besides you are free to use the kitchen (probably the best part in the house for me, personally).<br/><br/>We had a pleasant stay at Grace apartment. We feel like home."
25123,61650,06-07-2010,124030,Paul,"I felt comfortable, very much at home.  Access was easy, lots of space, very good breakfast food, drinks, were provided. The kitchen is great, and Grace is really pleasant and helpful, with taxi reservations, info, etc.   Two tube stops handy. Only one caution: the shower is weird, hard to adjust the temperature, and there's no curtain so the floor gets wet. "
25123,68950,25-07-2010,75078,Angela,Grace was a very gracious host; her apartment is very convenient for visiting London; just a 10 minute walk to the Tube stop.  She keeps a very clean and tidy apartment and my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised at how large the bedroom is.  Would definitely recommend and will stay there again!
25123,79991,17-08-2010,120013,Victor,"Grace's house is very clean, cosy, tidy and lovely. We totally recommend. The room we stayed is very comfortable and spacious. The place is about 8 minutes walking from the underground station, on the Northern Line, which is divided in two branches and takes you directly to important places in the city center. There are bus stops and a great supermarket very near as well. After all, Grace is really nice and friendly, we had such a good time with her. Thanks, Grace!  You're welcome in our house, so we can prepare other different dishes together."
25123,88171,01-09-2010,118329,Monica,"La casa e l'accoglienza di Grace meritano 5 stelle!<br/>Grace e' solare e sorridente, disponibile per ogni richiesta.<br/>Fantastica la colazione: a disposizione degli ospiti succhi di frutta, cereali, marmellate,Nutella, caffe', cioccolata,the,latte,yogurt, formaggio, salumi,pane....<br/>La cucina a disposizione per prepararsi i pasti e' dotata di ogni attrezzatura possibile.<br/>Tutto e' pulito e profumato.<br/>Consigliatissimo per una super vacanza a Londra come e' stata la nostra.<br/>Grazie Grace!!!<br/>Monica & Debby<br/>"

25123,107260,28-09-2010,210522,Eric,"My wife and I had a great time with Grace!  We spent three days in London and were looking for a cheap, safe and clean place we could stay. That's just what we found at Grace's.  She has set up her house perfectly for visitors.  Each room has a separate lock. She stocks her fridge with toast, jam, coffee and tea.  And, she keeps it super-clean.  Her neighborhood is safe, too!  Grace, thanks for housing us for two nights.  Cheers!"
25123,110652,03-10-2010,237836,Shawna,Grace's house is perfectly clean and comfortable. Grace is bright and cheerful.
25123,128822,28-10-2010,86100,Abbey,"We stayed at Grace's place for 10 days and it was great. Her home is large, inviting, and very clean. We were able to get into the city center quickly and never had a problem with the transportation choices (rail or bus). We even enjoyed touring the nearby Golder's Green shopping area that has some good restaurants itself. Grace is thoughtful and friendly and made our stay really lovely. I recommend this for anyone staying in London!"
25123,136771,10-11-2010,264066,Peter,"I'm not sure what to say that hasn't already been said - Grace is wonderful and helpful, and the room was spacious and incredibly comfortable. Really a great experience - I will definitely try to stay here again the next time I'm in London."
25123,144994,27-11-2010,52087,Phil,It was just like living at home!

25123,169871,12-01-2011,204902,Sara,"We stayed at Grace house for a week and it was great. The room was spacious and clean, the house is located on a quiet street, so noise. Grace is very friendly and great host. I would defiantly recommend Grace place to stay in. "
25123,171895,18-01-2011,297248,Adrienne,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Grace's home.  Her house is so tidy and comfy.  She provided plenty food, amenities, and overall warmth.  Grace is such an interesting friendly woman.  I was privileged to be able to share her home.  I would highly encourage any traveler to make Grace's home their home."
25123,180577,10-02-2011,38241,Lenny,"Grace is the gold standard for a professionally run B &B.  Bedrooms and communal spaces are tastefully appointed, spacious and kept meticulously clean and quiet.  Guests have full access to kitchen with complete cookery, washing machine and dinner/living space.  Grace's generosity in providing breakfast foods (eggs, cereal, cold cuts,breads, biscuits, coffee, teas) and beverages (every juice imaginable, bottled water, etc.) is way above and beyond the call.   Shopping, good and diverse ethnic restaurants, and public transit on tube and bus are all readily available. "
25123,198414,14-03-2011,388558,David,"Pleasant, clean, quiet, and enjoyable. Brent Cross is a fair haul from the typical tourist areas - about :35 minutes at the best of times via the Tube. Being in a largely Jewish neighborhood, everything closes down on Friday nights for Sabbath, so remember to do any food shopping before closing. Grace is a very pleasant and personable host."
25123,202694,19-03-2011,121790,William,"Great place to stay, Grace is a generous host and is quite welcoming.  One plus for me, that is probably not relevant to many, but I'll mention it anyway:  this is a good place to stay for someone doing research in the British Library newspaper archives, 5 minutes to the tube, 5 minutes on the train and you're at the archives.  Even if you're going to the main British Library at St. Pancreas, this is good place.  Evenings are quiet, so you can get some work done, if you're so inclined."
25123,212717,29-03-2011,456362,Emmanuel,"It was a realy pleasure,Grace is an Angel.J ai passé un merveilleux sejour dans un calme absolu.Merci pour tout Grace,ton sourire est RADIEUX."
25123,365442,11-07-2011,493774,Elena,"I spent a lovely week at Grace's in July 2011. The house is very well located (5-7 minutes from the tube), the borough is super quiet and safe which was one of the main criteria for me. Rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable. I really appreciate it that Grace was patiently waiting for me though I reached the place after midnight, she showed me around, explained everything to me. <br/>She is a great host, friendly and nice, she provides her quests with all sorts of food: yougurts, cheese, ham, juice, water, milk etc. It's all well arranged. <br/>The place is super clean and well kept, I’m sure you’ll enjoy staying with Grace as much as I did. Believe me you won't be disappointed. <br/>Thank you Grace, hope to meet you again one day.<br/>"
25123,397883,26-07-2011,421357,LaToya,"LOVED MY VACATION!!!! Grace's place is lovely! My partner and I just returned from a 6 day stay in London, and I have to say, it was truly amazing. And staying at Grace's was one of the reasons.<br/><br/>I can't say enough about her and her home. Grace was a very gracious, helpful host. Her home was cleaner and more comfortable than some hotel rooms I've been in. Her kitchen was always stocked with food for a self catered breakfast (which was really helpful when your a tourist and don't really want to waste time eating out for breakfast.) and it was always clean.<br/><br/>The room was a comfortable size with a comfortable bed and wifi. There is a shared bathroom, but even with the two other rooms in the house occupied, it wasn't a problem.<br/><br/>The location was perfect for us. It was a relly easy commute to central London. After sightseeing in the heart of London, it was nice to go back to the peace and quiet of a neighborhood.<br/><br/>We plan on making another visit to London early next year and we plan to stay with Grace again!!!!!"
25123,431383,09-08-2011,349137,Yumi,"We have been travelling around the world with Air'b'n'b for almost 6 months and this has been the best experience we have had so far! Grace is lovely and her place is clean, welcoming and in a nice/ quiet area. We stayed for 2 weeks and she was kind enough to clean the room after the first week and change our bedding and towels. Great location. We went jogging every morning near Hampstead which has a beautiful park and forest area. Cute shops and cafes at Hampstead also. We found great Lebanese and Turkish restaurants near Golders Green. We would love to stay here again when we return to the UK. Thanks Grace for being such a lovely host!"
25123,451593,16-08-2011,929988,Nele,"Very clean and nice place to stay !! <br/>Grace is very good host. Thank you!"
25123,466946,22-08-2011,929958,Stefano,"Esperienza ottima! la casa è davvero carina e la stanza confortevole. E' una sistemazione pulita, spaziosa ed accogliente ad un buon prezzo per Londra. Letto comodo, colazione abbondante ma soprattutto Grace fa la differenza: molto gentile, cordiale e disponibile! Inoltre la casa è a pochi passi dalla fermata di metropolitana della Northen Line...poche fermate e sei nel centro della città!"
25123,503200,05-09-2011,940759,Lemont,I had a wonderful time at Grace's during my holidays in London. Grace is truly a welcoming and gracious host. My experience was like going home to visit family and staying with a friend or relative. I will definitely look-up her listing on my next trip. Thanks Grace for great first-time experience in London!
25123,596321,04-10-2011,715462,Geraldine,"Grace is a most excellent host! She is very friendly and easy to talk to and more than willing to help. Every time we see her, she's always smiling and happy! It was really nice to chat to her. We felt really at home.<br/><br/>The room is clean and spacious. We stayed for more than 2 weeks and she offered to change our bedsheets after a week or so which was really nice! <br/><br/>The location is just a short distance away from Brent Cross station and Golder's Green. It is a quiet Jewish neighbourhood and very safe at night. There are plenty of grocery shops and places to eat at Golder's Green so not to worry. Both stations are on the northern line which doesn't seem to get much delays or disruptions which is good. It's easy to get to zone 1 too.. just abit long. <br/><br/>We used her kitchen and her washing machine with no problems. And stayed up to watch tv all night. I hope we weren't too noisy! haha.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend Grace's place to anyone.<br/><br/>This was our first time staying with airbnb and it was a great experience. We even had a nice time chatting with another traveller staying there who came from South Africa. <br/><br/>I will definitely be doing this again. :)"
25123,959256,28-02-2012,1618844,Tiago,Grace was an explendind host. She was also very helpful providing all the relevant information and maps regarding the routes and transports.

Anywhere that provides decent granary bread and Horlicks has my seal of approval. The house was incredibly clean and welcoming, sometimes it felt a little cold, but other than that I had a lovely stay."

25123,3547893,15-02-2013,3784440,Stephanie,"We stayed at Grace’s home for two nights. She and her boyfriend are very nice. They were helpful, arranging a taxi for us. Grace’s house is perfectly clean, it can’t be any better. The house and our room was tastefully furnished, but without any odds and ends. You share the bathroom with the host and other guests, but that was no problem at all and everything perfectly in shape. A wide range of food is provided for breakfast (different juices, jams, cereals, etc.), everything fresh and appetizingly. The house is quite and in a good neighbourhood, a few minutes from tube station Brent Cross. We had a wonderful time and I totally recommend staying here!"

She even received us at a late hour, as our flight arrived only at 10 p.m.<br/>We will most definitely come back and recommend it to everyone who is looking for a comfortable, quiet (but cheerful), clean house in London! <br/>Thank you Grace!"
25123,3840092,19-03-2013,2865139,Nicola,"My stay with Grace was perfekt! She lives in a small house in a typical british village area which was a great experience. Very quiet and good connection to the tube and also to Luton Airport.<br/>The room was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was free to use and everything for breakfast (cereals, toast, tea,...) was already provided. Would come back anytime!"

25123,4882841,30-05-2013,4453506,Alan,"Grace was a wonderful Hostess!  Her place was immaculate, and probably one of the most comfortable accommodations I have ever stayed.  Location was a nice, quiet, and beautiful suburban neighborhood; walking distance to the train station.  There was an Early Morning/Late Night market near buy that had just about any necessity one could use during travel, (including power converters).  Thank You So much for your kindness and hospitality Ms. Grace!  =)  "
25123,4997929,06-06-2013,4159494,Elizabeth,Grace was a lovely host. Her charming house is located just a short hop from Brent Cross Station on the Northern Line in a quiet residential neighbourhood off Montpelier Rise and very convenient to a huge 24-hour Tesco for those midnight munchies :) My room was spacious and tastefully appointed. There was even breakfast provided. I would definitely recommend everyone to have a stay with Grace!
25123,5056705,10-06-2013,4532411,Xinyuan,Nice place and nice room. Very recommend you to live. 
25123,5165224,16-06-2013,6480083,James,"Grace was a fantastic host, striking the perfect balance between personal and professional. The room was spacious and comfortable with tasteful furniture. Grace's home is full of flourishing flora which is, in my opinion, the sign of a great homemaker! <br/>I only saw Grace twice—when I checked in and the morning I left—and didn't see or hear any of the other three guest who were staying and never had a problem accessing the bathroom in the morning. The fridge was always fully stocked with a variety of juices, bottled water, bread, milk, jams etc as well as load of cereals. My first Air B&B experience was great and I will definitely return when I am working in Hampstead in the future. Thanks Grace! X"
25123,5243918,20-06-2013,6173421,Jos,"A simple but very clean room. TV wasn´t working, but personally I don´t mind that.  Grace is a very friendly woman and sincerely interested. The breakfast is simple as wel, but ok. The rooms are very close (7 minutes walk) to the Bent Cross tube station, so that's a big pro. Personally, I liked the neighborhood. <br/><br/>In my eyes there´s only one serious point for improvement. When lying on the bed I could feel the springs. They were not stabbing and pointy, but not comforting as wel... On the other side: I heard from many people that's a common problem in London, even in above average Hotels like Holiday In Express. <br/><br/>The biggest pro's are the clean rooms and Grace, a very friendly host. <br/>The biggest minus regards the mattress of the bed. <br/><br/>To come to a conclusion: I'll be happy to book a room at Grace's again."
25123,6709471,22-08-2013,7210059,Jill,"A good place to stay with easy access to Central London. Safe walk to train station, especially at night. Room was big, light, clean and comfortable, just as described. Grace was very helpful and easy to get on with with."

25123,7966234,10-10-2013,2438455,Michael,"Grace is a great host!<br/>Always friendly and helpful in everything I asked her advice about.<br/>She gave me great advice regarding the surrounding area, nearby eateries , tube stations etc.<br/>The fridge was always stocked with fruit juices that I love, bread and jam so breakfast was no problem.<br/>Room is spacious and bed was great.<br/>Wifi works well and Internet is very fast for those who need to do some work (I needed to).<br/><br/>"
25123,8259134,22-10-2013,8075678,Carol,"I picked Grace's home because of the great reviews I read prior to booking.  This was my first B n B experience and I was most impressed;  The home is in a convenient location, easy to get to the tubes.<br/>Grace was more than helpful, she emailed me with valuable information before  I arrived.  Since this was my first time in London this information helped to ground me.<br/>The home is spotless, organized and pleasant.  Grace goes out of her way to offer any assistance that is required.  I would definetly return and recommend this home.<br/>Keep up the good work Grace, you deserve a lot of credit for your business sense and organizational skills.<br/>Carol"
25123,12235374,27-04-2014,11672955,Ruth,This was my first airbnb experience and a very positive one. I enjoyed my stay with Grace. She is a friendly and helpful host who has a bright and spotless home. There are a few home rules and these are clearly spelt out so there can be no confusion. As I have problems eating yeast she bought soda bread for my breakfast which was nice of her as there was also cereal available. I would certainly be happy to stay here again.  
25123,22167278,31-10-2014,16637585,Stephen,"Grace is a very kind and helpful host. I stayed at Grace's house for 3 nights, and I enjoyed my stay. The house is very clean and tidy and the kitchen well stocked. <br/>Thank you Grace for a lovely stay. "

Dopo un primo momento di confusione in quelle strade tutte uguali, è davvero facile e veloce raggiungere tutto, anche il supermercato Tesco. La casa antica e caratteristica londinese è molto carina e ben curata e pulita. La colazione è abbondante e con molta scelta e la disponibilità di cucina e frigo ottima. Ci torneremo di sicuro."

25123,27253726,01-03-2015,20939808,Benjamin,"I stayed with Grace for six weeks while undertaking doctoral dissertation research in London. I have honestly never met an Airbnb host more willing to make you welcome and at home.  She is an amazing person: unfailingly kind, considerate, funny, smart, and caring. The room - even by my American standards - was enormous, with two full-size closets, dresser, desk, and shelving. The house is spotless, comfortable, and quiet. She provides a full suite of cooking appliances in her beautiful kitchen, and even includes breakfast in the Airbnb rate (a rarity these days). Grace deservedly expects you to keep her house clean and quiet - an easy task. I will definitely stay with her again, and I highly recommend her to any friend or colleague who wants a cozy place to stay while working or studying in London. "
25123,28847052,30-03-2015,266229,Richard,"Grace felt us welcomed to her house. The place is sparkling clean and it has everything that is needed to feel comfortable there.

Everything about this experience, from initial contact to departure was friendly.  Grace  made her feel welcome the minute she walked into her lovely home.  The room was spacious and the rest of the house very clean and well maintained.  The neighborhood is great and completely accessible to much of London and I had no fears of my daughter being out during the evening hours.  I would totally rebook with Grace for my daughter (or any of us!) were I in need of a London accommodation.  She truly makes you feel more a part of a family than a guest who was simply renting a room!"

Les conseils de Grace étaient parfaits. <br/>L'accès au centre de Londres est rapide, environ 10 minutes de marches jusqu'au métro et environ un quart d'heure jusqu'au centre. Très pratique.<br/>Nous avons passés un excellent séjour et prêt à revenir si l'occasion se présente.<br/>"
25123,34525263,09-06-2015,11672955,Ruth,It was lovely to return to Grace's last week and take up residence in the same room in this sunny well kept house. After a week of travelling we enjoyed being able to prepare dinner in her well equipped kitchen after shopping at the nearby supermarket. Felt right at home in the area again with its good transport and easy access to London sights. Grace is as previously a friendly and helpful host who makes you feel at home in her home. We look forward to returning very soon.

Even when we were early on arriving Grace carried all our luggage up the stairs whilst we went out shopping. She was so helpful in giving us tips on where to travel and provided all the necessities for our weeks stay. The place was tidy and our room was very spacious. The location is great as it's very close to a tube line and shopping centre. After staying with Grace we would definitely recommend her to our friends and family.

25123,102856762,19-09-2016,39058615,Tannuva,Grace was amazing! she was not home when I arrived but she made sure there was someone home to welcome us. The place was soo clean and perfect! She even bought breakfast for us. Thank you Grace!
25123,103363473,22-09-2016,78355532,Jaren,"Grace is the best! She is seriously the nicest person. She is very welcoming and super fun to talk to. She made sure I felt right at home there. I would definitely stay again. The location was perfect for me, easy to get to and from the city. This is one of the best airbnbs I've stayed in! "

25123,109239044,20-10-2016,16605211,Chintal,"Grace was very good at communicating before arrival and even though I didn't meet her everything went smoothly. I had a very comfortable stay. The room is nice and big with a desk and chair facing the window, perfect for doing some work whilst the sun streams in! The house is lovely and spacious and very clean and tidy. Grace is also kind enough to provide breakfast which is lovely and an added value compared to some of my other stays. The house is a 5 minute walk from the tube station which itself only takes 10 minutes into central London so very convenient. Would definitely recommend Grace's home and would be very happy to stay again. Thank you!"
25123,110318886,25-10-2016,13923272,Maja,"Der Check-In war super und trotz später Nacht Anreise wurden wir von Grace herzlich empfangen. Unser Zimmer war für Londoner Verhältnisse recht groß und geräumig. Auch die Sauberkeit im Zimmer war super, durch das Teilen des Badezimmers mit den anderen Gästen war die Sauberkeit im Bad manchmal nicht ganz gegeben, aber dafür kann Grace ja nichts. WLAN funktionierte super, die Lage war in Ordnung( ca. 10 Min. Laufweg bis zur nächsten Metrostation.) , das Preis-/Leistungs Verhältnis hat auf alle Fälle gestimmt. Positiv Hervorzuheben ist der gefüllte Kühlschrank( Wasser/Milch/O-Saft) für die Gäste! Vielen Dank an Grace!"
25123,122119902,21-12-2016,74398982,Alberte,Grace was a great host! <br/>This was my first time traveling alone and being away for more than 1 month so I was very nervous when I arrived in London but Grace and the other guests made me feel at home as soon as I walk in the door! <br/>Living there was the perfect combination of company and privacy and if you needed anything you just needed to ask! Grace also made it possible for my family to come visit me which meant a great deal for me. I would definitely stay there again. <br/>Thanks for opening your home. 👍🏻
25123,123053231,27-12-2016,83287496,Daren,"Amazing place with a nice spacious house and big clean room. Location was 20 minutes into the city by train, and had a huge Tesco in walking distance.

25123,202878238,13-10-2017,78355501,Mengcheng,很干净的房子，我是来伦敦交换一学期所以短租，交通便利
25123,252870676,12-04-2018,103563521,Hajar,Grace' s home is wonderful if you want a clean and peaceful escape from the hustle of the city. About a 30-40 minute trip to central London via public transit which is about a 5 minute walk. Not ideal if you want to be in the center of the action but great if your goal is a quiet night's rest after a day of sightseeing.
25123,254834644,18-04-2018,101322738,Nikhil,"I had a great time at Grace's place. Everything was clean, quiet, and hassle-free. I would recommend the place especially for long stays, because it feels like you're at home.<br/>Also, Grace was very friendly, and was nice enough enough give me info about London in great detail."

25123,259549857,01-05-2018,12760317,Jone,Grace es muy agradable y simpática. La habitación está muy limpia y es muy amplia y luminosa. La casa está cerca de la estación de metro y en media hora estás en el centro. Sin duda la mejor opción para alojarse en Londres.

Grace is a very cool and lovely person and also a great housemate. I have nothing to complain about and I would absolutely recommend to visit London and stay with Grace."
25123,436141559,12-04-2019,171365324,David,"Grace has a wonderfully cosy Airbnb. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and had every necessary item that one needs. The shared facilities (kitchen, living room, bathroom..) were all clean and easy to use. There are plants everywhere in the Airbnb, which is very relaxing as it gave the impression of being in a yoga retreat centre. It was a lovely stay in London!"
25123,442426326,23-04-2019,237495225,Dalila,"Una experiencia hermosa, la casa era muy limpia y ordenada, grace es una anfitriona de maravilla, contabamos con cocina y lavarropas lo que hacia todo mas facil"
25123,445868274,30-04-2019,250811751,Adam,"Room, it's space and equipment is equal to prize. The equipment is simple, nothing too special about it. The house is lovely, shared space is well kept an Grace is the best host you can possibly ask for. Not only she is absolutely helpful in person, but she checks if everything is all right via messages. She is easy going and there is probably nothing that would disappoint you in her"

There is no need to worry about supplies and transportation because a mega supermarket and a tube station are within walking distance. Besides, Grace is a friendly and accommodating host. :)"
25123,570762881,30-11-2019,6152847,Benjamin,"For me this really was an exceptionally pleasant stay, and I think it's because Grace takes great care of the house, has a warm personality, and is very kind to the people around her. I'll definitely return."

31036,58670,28-06-2010,148537,Don,"My wife and I stayed at Tom's place and really loved it.<br/>His apt is quite large and resides in a very fun/hip area of London which is amazing considering how cheap his rates are. <br/>Brick Lane is a really fun area and a great location to get to almost anywhere in London as well.<br/>We really appreciated his suggestions for places to eat and visit and highly recommend it to anyone thinking of visiting London. Thanks for everything Tom."
31036,63116,10-07-2010,141140,Laurent,"Well the room was ok, only that it s 10m from the railway so forget about sleeping there if you need calm to fall a sleep.<br/>The room was not that clean either.So if you have any place to go, than avoid this one<br/>"
31036,74973,07-08-2010,162481,Mario,"Tom and Kiki were wonderful hosts. The welcomed us with open arms and made us feel at home. The flat is well located (access to the 8 and 388 bus routes, or a 10min walk to one of 3 tube stations). And if Indian/Bengali food is you thing, you are in heaven. Brick Lane is like a ""little Bengali"" food is cheap and tasty. (There are also other types of resto's, not just Bengali). A few busy pubs in the area too.<br/><br/>Tom gave us excellent recommendations for eateries and accommodated us whenever we had a problem.<br/><br/>Thanks again Tom and keep in touch!<br/>"
31036,84056,24-08-2010,194975,Rosemary,"I have nothing to fault with my stay in Tom's. He was welcoming without being pushy; the place was gorgeous, the room really tidy and the facilities top notch. Tom was also happy to help me with anything (phone charging, taxi booking!) I needed. A great experience."
31036,104106,24-09-2010,229252,Padma,"Kiki was the perfect host; she made us feel at home, answered all our (many) questions and gave us some excellent advise. <br/>The flat is lovely and perfectly located.

31036,128433,27-10-2010,256373,Faruk,"If you’re looking for a chill place to stay, close to lots of fun and excitement, Tom & Kiki’s is a great choice. Relaxed hosts that give you all the room you may need but who are also very friendly, warm and welcoming if you want to be more social. A fun place (with a puppy! so adorable) in an incredibly fun part of town. Brick Lane activities and shops are just around the corner, with almost anything walking distance. <br/><br/>Depending on what room of theirs you get, you may be either close to the railway tracks or the street side (busy on Sunday mornings), but I’ve found this no real issue in my stay. YMMV of course, but overall I heartily recommend Tom & Kiki’s."
31036,145664,28-11-2010,261030,Edna,"We had a great time staying at Tom and Kiki's place.<br/>We can recommend this place as it is located perfectly (close to Brick lane) and they were always helpful (arranging Keys and finding Bus connections).<br/>Although the room has a window to railway tracks, we slept comfortably.<br/>They have a cute little dog named Hendrix that will always give you a warm welcome :)<br/>We will gladly come back next time we stay in London.<br/>"
31036,148619,04-12-2010,276030,Nanna,"Fantastic area and very friendly hosts. The room is very basic, but was perfect for our needs. "
31036,154026,14-12-2010,47848,Clara,"Great location, great puppy, great host :-)<br/>Brick lane is a lively place, so it's a bit noisy I suppose, but if you're in London, you're not supposed to rest, so  enjoy the market and don't complain!!<br/>top notch spot, not sure I should talk too much about it, or it will be crowded !"
31036,170812,15-01-2011,336683,Saida,"I have stayed in TWO of Kiki and Tom's rooms and couldn't recommend them enough! Comfy beds, very clean and they are excellent hosts! The back room is a little noisy due to the train, so if you're particularly sensitive, it may be something to be aware of - but all in all, a great place to stay in central London. "
31036,172866,20-01-2011,303946,Rob,"Enjoyed staying at Tom & Kiki's place.<br/>Comfortable, modern apartment. Great location. <br/>Perfect for exploring Shoreditch, Brick Lane, etc.<br/>Close to transport so getting around town also pretty easy.<br/>Room did back onto rail line but was never a problem getting a good night's sleep.<br/>Happy to recommend."
31036,179465,07-02-2011,363883,Joe,"This was my first airbnb experience and I loved it! Tom and Kiki are very hospitable! They gave me the privacy of a hotel, yet offered to show me around too. The location is Brick Lane, which is a short walk to the underground and in a fun part of town. "
31036,184694,19-02-2011,377892,Jolin,"My husband and I stayed at Tom and Kiki's lovely home for a week and it was wonderful experience. They are very attentive and always available.  The room has a door to the garden, so you can have your coffee there when the weather is nice. You also have a PRIVATE BATHROOM which probably is the best of all. It's 2 minutes walk to Brick Lane and near central London. They also have a very playful dog Hendrycks, you're gonna love him! Overall, staying here really gives you a homy feeling after a long day out!"
31036,194663,08-03-2011,385397,Anne-Victoire,"Second time i came but hope to stay there each time i'm coming London!!<br/>Great place, great district, welcoming hosts!"
31036,227024,15-04-2011,142411,Jill,"Scott and I had a wonderful stay at Tom and Kiki's place. We found the  Brick Lane section of London to be a wonderful mix of different cultures and subcultures.  We had some fabulous curries there.  Tom recommended a great restaurant called Meraz to us.  We loved it so much we went back a second time with friends.  The Sunday Market is also a fun place to walk around. Tom and Kiki's place is very clean and well located.  I think our favorite part of our stay was Tom and Kiki's wonderful dog Hendrycks.  He is one of the sweetest dogs we have ever met and so well behaved!  Tom and Kiki are wonderful, helpful hosts and we would highly recommend their place."

Not only is their home in a quiet, convenient, and trendy location, but they are a lovely couple and provided very helpful suggestions and information to us during our stay in London.

31036,382796,19-07-2011,514929,Michael,"I only spent 2 nights at Kiki and Toms place but it gave me a great opprtunity to discover Brick Lane. It certainly has changed a lot in the last few years. The apartment is about 15-20 minute walk from Liverpool Street Station and just 3 minutes from Brick Lane itself. The area is great with lots of bars, clubs and restaurants close by. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Kiki and Tom but they were easily contactable and had everything organised for my arrival. Well worth staying in at this very funky apartment. I was in the back room near the train line but didnt have any problem sleeping even though it can be a bit noisy."
31036,386862,21-07-2011,344747,Carla,We enjoyed our stay with Tom and Kiki (we didn't get to meet Kiki). Their place is in a really great location with easy access to the underground or tube. The room was clean and comfortable. We appreciated the suggestions for dinner and would recommend the Indian place just off Brick Lane. The best Indian we have had in the UK! We would stay here again.

31036,415742,02-08-2011,340774,Alexander,"Tom and Kiki are both friendly and accommodating, not to mention understandable of the fact that I was extremely jet-lagged and that I arrived in London at 6AM. The apartment is quite nice and the bed is comfortable. The neighborhood is great: great markets (Flower market) on the weekend, lots of shops, extremely ""hip."" I am sure I am saying nothing new. It was a nice experience."
31036,421420,05-08-2011,795202,Greg,"Tom and Kiki are fabulous hosts! They are amazing people who are kind, friendly and welcoming. They gave us loads of suggestions on places to eat around town too. Lovely hosts for our first Airbnb experience. "

31036,431263,09-08-2011,620694,Claudia,"We stayed there for 2 nights and had a great time. Tom and Kiki are great hosts, very friendly and helpful and we even had dinner together with them and their friends. The house is in a good location, 5 min walk to the tube. As all the others already said the room is quite loud because of the railway, but after 2 days of walking trough London we didn't really care and just fell asleep immediately. If we come back to London we'll definitely try to stay there again."
31036,439923,12-08-2011,34616,Anna & Jody,"Kiki & Tom are great airbnb hosts. They are friendly and relaxed and made us feel very welcome and comfortable.

31036,454852,18-08-2011,486061,Lars,"Super great hosts, perfect location, nice big bathroom, attractive gardens, generous use of kitchen and home furnishings.<br/>The location is most suitable for sightseeing - within 12 minutes you are off the apartment by foot and bus to Liverpool Station.<br/>The DLR behind the house was no problem. There is a lot of Shops and small bars available nearby. On Sunday it was, even right in our opinion, the best borough-market of the city. Such an accommodation we desire to any visitors of London. "

It suited my needs perfectly.<br/><br/>I didn't actually stay in the double room, since Kiki kindly bumped me up to the queen room! Very nice and unexpected.<br/><br/>I'm really glad there are places like this, so we're not forced to stay in boring and impersonal hotels!<br/>"
31036,565898,25-09-2011,999042,Kenneth,"Tom and Kiki had a very clean place. We had our own room and toilet and shower. The flat was very nice and about a 10 minute walk to Shoreditch Overground. Overall, a very good experience and I would recommend this place to others!"
31036,630346,16-10-2011,638310,Ali,"This is a smallish but tidy bedroom (with hideaway double bed) in a cool, comfortable apartment just a block off Brick Lane, in the East End of London. It's a few minutes' walk from trains and buses, as well as great local sights such as Old Spitalfields Market. You have your own bathroom, although it's not en suite and you have to walk through the living room to get to it. (They have another bedroom with en suite available at a higher rate.) <br/><br/>We didn't see Tom much as he was working, but Kiki was friendly, hospitable and very easygoing. They also have an adorable puppy who loves to play, a definite plus if you're a dog lover.<br/><br/>As other reviews have mentioned, there is indeed a train line outside the bedroom window, but even though we could hear trains regularly, the sound was a low grumble that receded into the background, and it didn't bother us at all – when I was up I could hear them, but when I was asleep they never woke me up. My boyfriend is a light sleeper and he wasn't awoken by them, either."
31036,646783,20-10-2011,314754,Nikki,"Our stay with Tom and Kiki was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better location - there's plenty happening on Brick Lane and the surrounding markets, not to mention the two tube stations which are less than 10 minutes walk away.<br/><br/>Tom and Kiki were kind enough to organise an early check-in (7.30am on a Saturday morning!) along with advice about where to eat and the best route back to the airport.<br/><br/>The room was the perfect size for two people and the bed was very comfortable. <br/><br/>We'd love to stay here again for our next trip to London."

31036,881852,24-01-2012,1597084,Deidre,"They didnt earn the ""super"" host badge for nothing! Awesome hosts, awesome flat. Amazing neighborhood. The only negative was the fact that it can get noisy outside... And Kiki was very upfront about that! I didn't even need to use the earplugs she provided. Anytime I come back to London I'm checking to see if their flat is available first! "
31036,892088,30-01-2012,48178,Giorgia,"Very clean and nice apartment in a great area. Our bathroom wasn't close to our room like the other house bedrooms but anyway confortable. Our room wasn't noisy at all since it isn't close to the street, even if sometimes you can ear a train running away! Kiki and Tomy were very kind and very helpful with us. Definitly I will try to come there next time."
31036,903023,05-02-2012,940259,Henrik,A great place to stay. Really lovely people.
31036,907431,07-02-2012,1262226,David,"As all the other reviews say: great place, great location, great hosts!"
31036,956494,28-02-2012,1651115,Sonya,"My stay with Tom and Kiki was little short of perfect. I felt completely at home. The apartment is perfectly located, and is really in the heart of all that is great about London.  The room was lovely and light filled with a super comfy bed! I won't hesitate to stay there again next time I'm in London. "
31036,964430,02-03-2012,1694397,David,"great people, perfect location in a great neighborhood!"
31036,975597,06-03-2012,797721,Charlotte,"We stayed at Tom and Kiki's for four nights and it was a very agreeable stay. We had a private bathroom and felt very comfortable in our room which even had a terrace (a perk if you're a smoker!). Kiki and Tom are very discrete guests and we practically never saw them. In other words, they make you feel at home by not making you feel that you are in their way.<br/>There was only a tiny thing that bothered us: being used to sleep in a very very quiet environment, we had trouble sleeping the first night because of the trains that run across the fence of the terrace. At nighttime it's ok though, but during the day they run every 2 minutes.<br/>Apart from that, the house is situated on a quiet street yet enjoys a very central placement."
31036,995402,13-03-2012,1631742,Olivier,Good experience in general. Tom & Kiki are nice hosts. You have to walk out of the room and pass trough the living room to get to the bathroom and you can hear the trains passing (till late evening or early morning) in your bed. Appart from that it's a really nice flat and the situation is just perfect if you like brick lane! 
31036,1008999,17-03-2012,1869295,Nick,"Great Stay, lovely place, great location, nice folks. No complaints whatsoever except I didn't get to enjoy myself more while I was staying thanks to 12 hour work days."
31036,1092442,07-04-2012,1550116,Bev And Mike,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and what a wonderful way to start.  I don't think we would have experienced London in quite such an authentic way if we hadn't stayed in this facinating area.  Bricklane is a real experience with such interesting people.  Kiki and Tom were excellent hosts and really gave us a ""home away from home"" experience.  Kiki a special thanks for helping us sort out the train to Liverpool which saved us quite a bit.  The bed was really comfortable and having a private bathroom was great as we are used to our private space.  If you are staying in this area, the Sunday flower market is a must."
31036,1167396,23-04-2012,728081,Rebecca,"Great place to stay in London! Apartment was very nice and clean, and Kiki was a great hostess. Would definitely reccommend."

31036,1275711,14-05-2012,1899456,Martin & Sigrun,"We really enjoyed our stay with Tom and Kiki. The double room is pretty big by london standards, well-furnished and bright. Tom and Kiki were lovely hosts, friendly, welcoming and helpful when necessary. A star attraction, if you like dogs, is Hendrix, definately beyond cute. Of course the location couldnt be much better if youre looking for an uber urban experience, though in truth there is much to see and do in this end of town if trying-too-hard-to-be-trendy galleries and a million vintage shops are not quite youre thing. If you dont mind the rattle of trains and the buzz of brick lane we would definately recommend the apartment."
31036,1307593,20-05-2012,632385,Caio,"Perfect location, great room and private bathroom, a beautiful home. And mainly: wonderful people.<br/><br/>Localização perfeita, ótimo quarto e banheiro privativos, uma casa linda. E pricipalmente: pessoas maravilhosas."

31036,1409075,04-06-2012,1410535,Isra,"Tom and Kiki are very nice. Their apartment is located really close to Brick  Lane and all venues around Shoreditch. We liked very much the area and will go back to Tom and Kiki next time around in London. The room and the whole apartment is beautiful and clean. The only concern we had was being at the ground floor having the railways passing by pretty close, but in the end we slept deeply. There is a nice terrace to BBQ or have something to drink in the unlikely case of a sunny day in London."

Other things to note, Kiki is a great cook, makes some mean cookies!! The place is very clean, Hendrix the dog is mega friendly and the Internet is blazing."
31036,1498301,17-06-2012,2387394,Annalisa,"Lovely very confortable sheets and feather pillowcases+bathroom+bedroom door that goes into a little cosy garden+nice warm young feel around the house. The house is situated in a very good strategic position (tube zone 1) with a very nice walk to Liverpool street via Brick Lane and Spitafield market. Tom and Kiki perfect hosts!<br/>Drawbacks but not for us: train noise (actually I quite liked it.. believe or not! We had our earplugs but never used them).<br/>Drawback for us:  you have to go through the living room/kitchen to get to your bathroom (but there is another room with en-suite that looks lovely as well) and.. there is not a bidet in the bathroom but ... this is England! LOVE TO BOOK HERE WHEN BACK IN LONDON<br/>NEXT TIME WITHOUT LOOKING ELSEWHERE!<br/><br/>"

31036,1555635,25-06-2012,2311081,Marcello,"L'appartamento di Tom&Kiki è moderno, bello e pulito. Loro sono gentili, molto informali. La colazione non è il loro forte, quindi compratevi qualcosa oppure chiedete appena arrivati se volete latte, pane o cose del genere. Cheshire st non è bellissima, soprattutto di sera, la metrò è a 10 minuti a piedi."

Shoreditch est un super quartier très ""arty"" avec plein de super boutiques, des galeries et plein d'endroits sympas pour les petits déj. On était en Zone 1 ce qui est très pratique, à 5mn de Shoredicth High Street et à 10 mn de Liverpool Station. We highly recommand this room !"

31036,2780145,01-11-2012,789622,Kerena,"It was my first experience with Airbnb and it was great. The flat is exactly how it looks in the photos and the neighborhood is great for vintage and boutique designer shopping. There's an amazing organic pizza restaurant nearby called Story Deli that I definitely recommend everyone to try (albeit a bit pricy but definitely worth it). <br/><br/>Although I didn't get a chance to meet Tom & Kiki in person (only their dog who was super friendly and adorable), they provided such great instructions to their place and the area, and even had earplugs available for the train noise which worked super well. The rain shower head in the bathroom was a luxury. I'd definitely recommend this stay and would stay here again if I have the chance!"

Everything is very clean.<br/>Kiki is very caring and was applied than we spend a very pleasant stay.<br/>Regarding the apartment, it is surrounded by galleries promoting young artists and very sharp music stores. The underground is just nearby. It is a bit away from the main streets , so the noise of the neighborhood is not too present late night.<br/>The neighborhood is very lively and it is easy to find what you may need: shops open late, restaurants, pub, nightclub, some charming little café / wifi to sit with a computer and a cup of tea. <br/>A good adress !"

A fun person to have a conversation with and very helpful, especially about great places to eat nearby (the Indian food off brick lane, wow!). Lots of other good stuff as well, like a comfortable bed and separate bathroom. I could go on but in short, everything was perfect!"
31036,3376795,20-01-2013,4380258,Héloïse,"Première expérience Air BnB et expérience réussie. Tom et Kiki sont des hôtes très chaleureux, gentils et discrets. Leur duplex est très beau. Le chien est adorable. Le quartier est super sympa. Ils vous donnent tous les renseignements dont vous avez besoin voir même plus, ils pensent à  tout, on se sent très bien chez eux. Pas étonnant qu'il y ai autant de commentaires positifs vu leur professionnalisme. Je suis très satisfaite et heureuse d'avoir passé quelques jours chez eux, cela valait la peine. Plus la peine de payer des fortunes dans des hôtels jamais à la hauteur quand on voit la qualité de service et le confort que nous offre des hôtes comme Tom et Kiki.<br/>Thanks for all, a wonderful stay at Kiki and Tom's home."

31036,3446681,31-01-2013,2759570,Dan,"Tom & Kiki's place is great! A very nice modern flat that feels like a home. They were both out of town during my visit, though I'm sure they're fantastic hosts. There's an Underground station just a 5-minute walk away, and they provided several local recommendations for places to eat & things to do that were super helpful. Would definitely stay here again."
31036,3527348,12-02-2013,1366036,Garance,"Our stay went very well. Kiki and Tom's is definitely an excellent place to stay in London, I always recommend it to friends travelling to London. <br/>This time, and since it was available, Kiki offered us to stay in the front bedroom, instead of the one we booked, which was very kind (front bdr has ensuite bathroom). Very clean and towels provided. <br/>The +: heaters can be turned on and get REALLY warm. Useful if you're cold (which you will be if you visit London during wintertime).<br/>The -: the double bed is not very wide (big enough for two but not king size)."

31036,4178948,16-04-2013,4514484,Peter,"We had a wonderful time staying at Kikis place! Although the trains outside were pretty loud we had no problem sleeping - but this was maybe caused by our exhausting daytrips through London.<br/>Kiki - and especially her dog Hendricks - is lovely and she had some great recommendations for us. The Shoreditch area is definitely worth a stay and if you do, be sure to catch some coffee at Nude Espresso and a full english at Yummys Cafe!"

He's goes to ""work"" every day so we didn't see enough of him, but that's just a reason to come again :)<br/><br/>Thanks for the great stay, guys!"
31036,4621067,16-05-2013,2924678,Oliver,The apartment was clean and the room was as seen in the pictures.  It is located within a very nice area of Shoreditch. The train tracks are located on the back of the room but didn't bothered us too much. Kiki and Tom are a very nice couple and really helpful. I can recommend staying at their place!

Tom & Kiki were a little busy during our stay but always friendly and helpful. There is noise from the train tracks but after two nights I got used to it. I would recommend the apartment and would book it again, also because I like the Shoreditch area of London very much. Several tube stations within easy walking distance, many bakeries and bagel shops, Indian restaurants and cool bars. "

Everything was around the corner: small boutique shops, cafes, bars, Old Truman Brewery (eateries and bars), flavors of Brick Lane, Shoreditch, a 24 hours bagel shop, etc...<br/><br/>The room and private bath were clean and the open kitchen and common area were an added bonus.  <br/><br/>Tom and Kiki are great hosts and we highly recommend their place.  <br/>"

We only saw Kiki briefly before she left for a trip, but she was a pleasure to meet, very warm and friendly. <br/>The bathroom is just down the hall, so even though its not an en-suite it's still really convenient. It was great having a kitchen available to us.(the markets have amazing meat, produce and baked goods, you'll definitively want to pick some extra up to take home!) <br/>We were in the backroom, so it's the closest to the train tracks. To be honest, you do stop noticing it after a while. I'm a very light sleeper and usually sleep with earplugs and the sound didn't wake me while i slept.<br/>The area is perfect, there's always tons going on just a few steps away. Check out Yummy's Cafe for a true English Breakfast. The Shoreditch area has tons of character, and great restaurants and pubs. Less than a 10 minute walk to Liverpool Street Station, and it takes minutes to get around London on the Tube.<br/>It was our first Air B and B experience and it was really good. We got to meet two lovely couple who stayed in the front room while we were there. <br/>Will definitely use Air B and B again!"

Everything went really smoothly, and Kiki sent us lots of useful information to help us get our bearings in the area. If you stay here and are looking for good, super cheap breakfast, go to the beigal shops just up brick lane.... Delicious filled bagels for less than 2 pounds! Oh, and the train noise was not that big of a deal to us--it didn't disturb our sleep at all. Also, the shower was amazing."
31036,5337804,25-06-2013,4863876,Johannes,"We really enjoyed our stay. Although we did not meet the hosts in person, everything from the booking to the checkout went nice and smooth. Kiki was very helpful and fast in responding to our e-mails.<br/>The appartment and the room were both very pretty and comfy and (super-clean) and the place is conveniently located near the vibrant Brick Lane with its vintage stores and wonderful bars and cafés. The only minor downside are the train tracks behind the backyard, but the hosts kindly provided us with earplugs. However, the trains should only be an issue, if you're super-sensitive when it comes to noise."

During our 4 weeks we have experienced all that hospitality, which we have read while checking previous comments of guests. Seamless communication with the hosts, internationally vibrant location (don't be mislead by reviewers' complaints about the train noise - one can get used to them in no time, especially with the earplugs provided:), clean room and bathroom, good kitchen facilities = highly recommended! Thanks Kiki, thanks Tom."

Our room was clean and suited our needs to a T. We had direct access to an outdoor patio from our room, and the flat was conveniently located near a number of tube/train stations.

I was in the room on the train line and it bothered me a lit less than I thought it might- and the bed was comfortable and the bathroom better than most five star hotels! Kiki was very helpful interns of neighbourhood tips and the most chilled host imaginable. <br/><br/>I walked EVERYWHERE night and day and the area was a visual feast and a social hub on all fronts.

The room was very clean and big and we had a bathroom just to use for our own. I met Kiki and her WONDERFUL dog, they both were so sweet to us that I really would come back to their place anytime! "
31036,8445363,31-10-2013,8921828,Ryan,"Tom and Kiki were super friendly and accommodating during my week long stay. They both made sure I had everything I needed and gave me tips on places to eat and drink around the neighborhood. The room was comfortable and the bathroom is very nice. I loved staying in Shoreditch. There are great cafes and restaurants literally around the corner, it's highly walkable and conveniently adjacent to many bus/train/tube lines. I would definitely stay here again."

Ich kann diesen Gastgeber nur weiterempfehlen. <br/>Danke für den schönen Urlaub!"
31036,1.00854E+18,23-10-2023,21196494,Christian,The apartment was well equipped and the location not far from Brick Lane was great. And a nice view toward the City's skyline :-)
31036,1.03326E+18,26-11-2023,218253053,Daniel,"Vi var två par som åkte torsdag-söndag för att upptäcka London. Boendet låg väldigt bra, bara 8 min gångavstånd från tunnelbanan. Modern och fräsch lägenhet med allt man behöver. Vi är nöjda på alla sätt."
33332,120040,16-10-2010,219483,Luigi,"The room is spacious and cozy, and the house is lovely.<br/>It also has Wi-Fi high speed Internet connection.<br/>There is a bus stop (H37) across the road, connecting to St Margarets railway station and to Richmond tube station (district line) in few minutes.<br/>At walking distance there is a nice path along the river Thames, which brings to Richmond.<br/>A convenience store is just few steps from the house, as a few other stores which I didn't try.<br/>10 minutes walking on St Margarets you will find the Ailsa Tavern, a pub which serves good dinners, which I loved.<br/>Chi-chi is a very discreet landlord, and I really suggest this accomodation.<br/>By the way, Richmond really deserves a visit! Great place."
33332,173829,23-01-2011,346341,Tammie,"We stayed three nights and overall the bed was very comfortable and the room was nice and warm. However, Chi Chi herself was not so warm the first night. We were startled with an abrupt knock on the door at 12:30am from Chi Chi asking us if we had been in any of her private rooms, particularly her bathroom. She was concerned that we had been going in and out of rooms and felt the need to confront us in the middle of the night. She kept me up for 15 mins confronting and inquiring about when we were getting up, where we had been, etc. It was quite unpleasant considering that we had just arrived from Los Angeles and we were completely jet-lagged. The next morning she was more pleasant and from that point on we didn't see her again until we checked out on the third day. If you are looking for a place that only allows access to and from your room to your bathroom then this is the perfect place for you. It has wifi and heating, but no tv access and no kitchen access. There are signs posted ""private"" throughout the house, which doens't create a very welcoming vibe. If you don't mind someone waking you up in the middle of the night and inquiring about your plans and your whereabouts, then this place shouldn't be a problem for you. "
33332,291640506,16-07-2018,113253616,Rui,"It is very near stadium and we come here to watch concert, it need about 30 minutes to walk there. House is nice, you need to prepare shampoo and water by yourself. There is a shop near the corner."

33332,6.52699E+17,19-06-2022,213168737,Frederik,Nice private room. Check in is strait forward and easy. Chi-chi is lovely and helpful. Local buses run very close by so its easy to get to the local train station and further into London city center.
33332,6.57757E+17,26-06-2022,11108229,Michael,"The space is immaculate--she offers a nice bedroom and private bathroom. A few things to be aware of. First, if you do not have a car, and you are wanting to use this space to access central London, it's at least 75 minutes' commute: a bus to the tube, and it's a long tube ride. And the area right around the place does not have much to offer--it's pretty residential. Also, she has an alarm system that she asks you to set when you leave and disarm when you arrive, which I found to be a pain. When I left at 9:30 am one day, the alarm was still set and I had to run and disarm it. But if you're ok with that hassle, and you don't mind the long commute, then the plan is nice and comfortable."
33332,6.62898E+17,03-07-2022,119214743,Hedi,Chi-Chi is a very kind and helpful hostess. The accommodation was tidy an very good located for our purposes. The connection to the centre of London is also excellent. Happy we could spent such a wonderful week!

The host Locking the front door preventing us from entering the accommodation until the police arrived, who we called after the host confiscated my luggage late at night for no other reason except for failing to comprehend an Alarm system and the host taking exception to us complaining in not having a key to lock our bedroom door. Metropolitan Police incident number was given to us by the police on the night.<br/>2.)     Evicted from the AirBnB Property late at night with nowhere planned to stay for the night is a safety issue.<br/>3.)     Abrupt rude and unjustified behaviour from the host.<br/>4.)     My partners Luggage was left unceremoniously dumped outside the house unlocked and unattended which included her work laptop and valuables.<br/>5.)     No mention on the Air-BnB website of having to master operating a complicated system for burglar alarms for both day and night alarms.<br/>6.)     No internal room keys to lock the door in a shared guest environment was totally dismissed by the host as unnecessary!<br/>7.)     Dirty cooker, sink etc. in our room was again dismissed by our host.  (*The cooker was in the bedroom (see photo) which may or may not be a health and safety issue?)<br/>8.)     False advertisement of the possibility of self-Check-in on the Air-BnB web page listing. (This self-check-in is a meet and greet so means waiting for the hosts availability!)<br/>9.)     No information in the property description about an adjacent guest room divided by a thin plaster board wall. (The Photo on Air-BnB website is misleading and shows a single entry door which leads one to believe that you have the loft space to your selves as a single entry to your room.)<br/>10.)  No room key to lock our bedroom door (Laptop, passports, house keys, valuables etc!)<br/>11.)  Being forced to suffer the indignity and embarrassment of phoning the police to resolve the issue of being locked out and not getting my possessions returned.<br/>12.)  Extra financial burden that was inflicted upon us as a result of a totally unjustified eviction.<br/>As with previous reviews I expect this host will not offer any constructive feedback nor admit to any failings on her behalf."

It also was next to the street, so there would be an occasional noise. Didn't bother me, though. I liked neighborhood and Tom and Kiki recommended a great place for dinner. They were very friendly and I enjoyed my stay. <br/>"
34935,176682,31-01-2011,352580,Jack,"Tom and Kiki were so so lovely....made us feel very welcome and knew the area really well, which was handy having not spent much time there before. The location of their place is insane, so good. Very close to tube, national rail and buses, not to mention brick lane. Pretty much perfectly situated. The room was great, very light and clean and lovely, and the rest of the house was exactly what we needed, big kitchen, amazing to cook in. Would absolutely stay here again, intend to in fact, and recommend it to everyone."
34935,191632,03-03-2011,333036,Ginger,Tom and Kiki were very warm and welcoming hosts! They were always very helpful and kind and were definitely fun to stay with.

34935,216871,04-04-2011,424784,Ted,"Tom and Kiki were fabulous hosts and made me feel like a guest in their home. They were very helpful in many instances, assisting me with some online ticket purchases and advising me of the best tube routes for getting to certain places and suggesting things to see and do in London. Their location was an excellent choice for me, as it was not touristy, had a great music CD store, a number edgy fashion shops mixed in with a great many vintage clothing and accessory stores, small market/convenience stores for groceries, newspapers/magazines, and a higher than average density of Indian restaurants, even for London. I felt like I was living amongst Londoners, yet it was an easy walk to several nearby tube stations to get to anywhere in London fairly quickly.  I would not hesitate to stay with Tom & Kiki again."

Brlliant for visiting Brick Lane market or going out to party in East London. <br/>The apartment is very comfortable and modern & the private bathroom is great. The front room can be noisy because of the street & Sunday market, so if you're sensitive, maybe bring earplugs. <br/>Tom & Kiki are very friendly and helpful, and you will love their dog Hendrycks! <br/>Overall a great place to stay, and when I return to London I would not hesitate to stay here again!

34935,228089,16-04-2011,481124,Stephen," I am a traveling professional and need comfortable private lodging at a fair price. Tom and Kiki are great hosts.. I felt very comfortable in their home. I prefer to be private and to respect my host's privacy - and this was perfect. For those who are cool hanging out in someone else's living room - Tom and Kiki are more than comfortable with guests.<br/>You can't go wrong - perfect location for access to the City and east end.<br/><br/>-"
34935,236557,23-04-2011,207628,Kristine,"Kiki’s place is terrifically located for the Shoreditch area….just down the street from the lively and eclectic Brick Lane.  Kiki provides a list of nearby cafes and such and so it might be a good idea to map these out before you come unless you have access to a smart phone while you’re there.   There are also lots of galleries around and one in particular, the White Cube had a wonderful exhibit while I was there and even better they had a wonderful detailed (free) map of the area – alone worth the visit.   Kiki’s place was comfortable and clean and Kiki was friendly and helpful.  "

The room is exactly as in the pictures,  the neighbourhood is terrific full of restaurants, cafes and bars and Tom and Kiki are very nice. Hendrycks is so charming! Just one objection, Sunday morning (very early) was really noisy due to the market just under our window. I would recommend earplugs."
34935,319891,17-06-2011,696703,Simon,"Excellent accommodation, clean and spacious and with en suite puts many hotels to shame. Close to colourful Brick lane and easy walking distance to good tube stations, many thanks to Tom & Kiki."

34935,360306,08-07-2011,12622,Liz,"The bedroom was comfy, with ample storage and a generous en suite, and Tom made us feel at home. A great spot to recover from jetlag, enjoy the shops and cafes of shoreditch, and pop into the big sites of london town. Timely and helpful info from Kiki was also much appreciated. Thanks guys!"
34935,369035,12-07-2011,723633,Maya,"Kiki wasn't home, so it was just Tom. Tom was nice, but the apartment wasn't what we were expecting. The floors were scratched and stained making the room seem dirty, even if it wasn't. Walls also had scuff marks. The sheets were pilled and thin, also making them feel dirty, even if they had just been washed. The throw pillows hadn't been washed, and free with them came a few long black hairs. The living room was also pretty disorganized, and the TV was blasting news when we arrived. This wouldn't have been THAT big of a problem, except that insulation was very, very thin, and one could hear every footstep between rooms. Tom was nice enough to turn it down. The apartment is well located, but be warned that it is on the first floor, street-side. Not knowing the area, etc, and with no lock on the individual door, my partner and I worried about security. The apartment door handle fell off when we arrived, but was somehow fixed shortly after? Confusing. None-the-less added to this worry. There is a nice back patio, but keep in mind it is by a train track. Would have not been so bad if we had REALLY known what it looked like. Pictures highly manipulated."
34935,379696,18-07-2011,548692,Hajime,"Tom and Kiki's place is situated in the hippest part of london.  If you are looking to be close to the artistic, tastemaking side of london, definitely book their place.  I staed in the bedroom with the queen bed and the pictures were just as they were on their profile.  Highly recommended"
34935,394364,25-07-2011,459401,Julia,"I stayed with Tom and Kiki for one week and had a great time. Friendly hosts, cute dog, well-equipped flat (Wifi, modern bath and kitchen) located in a nice area with good tube-access - I would stay there again if coming back to London. As other guests recommended: bring earplugs."
34935,401594,27-07-2011,575828,Brett,"Had a perfect time there - great hosts! Easy, central, couldnt ask for more."
34935,419651,04-08-2011,787824,Siim,"Nice stay, everything was smooth and the small garden with tables is nice. Get yourself a pair of earplugs for sleeping (Kiki will also provide you if you don't have your own) and you'll enjoy your stay."
34935,431077,09-08-2011,438934,Mike,"Enjoyed our stay. Small room with ensuite but cosy. Brick Lane area is quite close to all amenities, bus, underground & Victoria Station. Kiki & Tom were very helpful & in one instance helped us out with a medication problem. Good restaurants (indian) close by in Brick Lane. Enjoyed our time."
34935,439937,12-08-2011,900492,Johnny,"Tom and Kiki were fabulous hosts. And their dog is absolutely amazing! Unfortunately, my stay was during the London riots, but I appreciated Kiki and Tom keeping us up-to-date on where was safe in London and where was not. They are very accommodating hosts...I highly recommend staying in their beautiful flat!"

34935,553579,21-09-2011,114875,Nathan,"Tom and Kiki are wonderful hosts. Plenty of space in the apartment so you don't ever feel like you are encroaching on anything. They were more than willing to help with places to go and recommendations of what to do. The only thing to note would be the noise - it's next to a train line, and there's also a bit of noise from the street on weekends - the kindly provided ear plugs were put to good use! Good location, and easy enough to get to London's main attractions from the house."
34935,577097,28-09-2011,727020,Lloyd,"Tom and Kiki have a lovely flat and the room they made available to us was great! Private with our own bath and the entrance was close so we didn't disturb them with our comings or goings.<br/><br/>I was actually surprised at how close we were to the sites and locations we want to explore. The maps didn't convey how close their flat actually was.<br/><br/>Kiki was very helpful in assisting in our trips and how best to get there. That was a GREAT help!<br/><br/>When we return, we plan to book their place again."
34935,589573,02-10-2011,909334,Shayla,"This is a great area of London with lots of history.  Kiki was a great host giving us tips on the best attractions to see, best ways to get there and even history of the area.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  Since the room is on the street side of the flat it is a bit noisy, however, they provided earplugs and after a day of walking the city you won't even notice the street noise.  I would love to stay here again!"
34935,600038,05-10-2011,513518,Krystal,Tom and Kiki were FABULOUS!!!! They were extremely helpful! Helped with getting a Taxi to the train station....and made sure we didn't miss it!!! (thanks again Kiki!)  Their dog Hendryks was such a DELIGHT!!! It was a very clean room and an AWESOME part of town with great vintage shops and markets nearby! I would definately recommend their flat to anyone!! 
34935,697019,06-11-2011,620558,Aurora,"I had a wonderful time staying with Tom and Kiki! Kiki went way out of her way to arrange the key drop, even offering to bring it by the office where I was working. The bed is extremely comfortable and the waterfall style shower is divine! Hendryks is one of the cutest, friendliest little dogs that I have ever met and is impossible not to love. I believe he's hypoallergenic as well, which is great for those who have allergies (like myself) but who still love dogs. The location is extremely close to several little pubs, great restaurants and charming boutiques. Will definitely be staying with them when I come back to London!"
34935,707121,10-11-2011,317654,Matthew,"Had a great few days in Kiki & Tom's place. The location was the clincher for us. Just a minute from Brick Lane and a short walk to Shoreditch and Hockston for the proper party experience in London.<br/><br/>Kiki also sent us a really helpful listing of all the great stuff to do around the area, don't miss the sunday markets and all of the amazing restaurants around the area ... "
34935,715548,14-11-2011,61963,Cecile,"We had the best London WE staying with Tom & Kiki: the welcoming was great, it was clean and design, private bathroom like in an hotel, we had our own keys. The location is just perfect, East London is the best neighborhood ever.<br/>We will undoubtly come back when we can!"
34935,741860,24-11-2011,312472,Fati,"We stayed in the room with en suite bathroom for a few days in September. The room was just as in the pictures and Tom and Kiki were very nice and helpful hosts, they went out of their way to help us with a few supplies as our bags did not arrive until the next day and gave us some great recommendations for restaurants and bars around. The only draw back was the noise level on Sunday morning as the market was being set up very early as the walls are rather thin... since that was our first night we were pretty concerned we would not be able to sleep for the rest of out stay but in the end the next nights were just fine as the street in itself is pretty quiet with little traffic. Having said that we already knew about the Sunday market as it was specified on the listing, on the reviews and made very clear by the earplugs provided on the night stands so we were not surprised by it. The only other issue we had was that the wifi was sometimes pretty hard to connect in our room and it would often disconnect but once you went into the living room it worked perfectly and it was fast. The location was very central and tube and bus options were all within 10  to 15 minutes walk. The neighborhood offered several trendy and nice bars and restaurants. Overall it was a pleasant stay and a good value for the price we paid."
34935,758474,01-12-2011,601399,Titania,"Staying in Kiki and Tom's guest room was a delight — super-comfy bed, huge wardrobes to stash our stuff in, luxe private bathroom, and Kiki was very sweet and helpful. The location was right in the middle of neighborhood-of-the-moment Shoreditch, with amazing shops for clothes, music, and housewares, as well as live music venues and restaurants. The only downsides were some noise from the train tracks behind the building (our hosts left earplugs by the bed, which we used at a neighborhood rock club) and a longish walk to the nearest tube stations."
34935,771139,08-12-2011,1271345,Borja,"Si no te importa el ruido esta casa es un buen sitio para estar en Londres, el barrio es estupendo, el metro está a 15 minutos (Aldgate East) y los autobuses a 7 minutos que te llevan al centro. Muchos restaurantes y bares y también un montón de galerías de arte. La casa está muy bien y puedes utilizar el salón y la cocina sin problemas. Lo único malo el ruido, las dos habitaciones que alquilan son muy ruidosas, en una por el tren y en la otra por los coches y la gente hablando alto por la noche, pero si te tomas dos o tres pintas antes de acostarte y eres de buen dormir no hay problema. Tom y Kiki muy bien, simpáticos y atentos para ayudar en todo."
34935,782661,13-12-2011,467672,Linda,"The best location I've ever stayed in London - basically you could spend a whole week in the neighbourhood without ever getting bored (or hungry!). Kiki and Tom are great hosts and their advice on where to go and where to eat (Indian food!!) is great and they really make you feel welcome. Oh, and the bathtub in the bathroom... well, you might just wanna stay there."
34935,861556,14-01-2012,1469790,Meghan,"We had a wonderful time staying with Tom and Kiki. The room was lovely, the location excellent, and they were very friendly easygoing hosts. Much recommended!"
34935,867924,17-01-2012,1508190,Amy,"The flat was nicely decorated, clean and very comfortable. The ensuite bath also a bonus. The wifi worked well. Plenty of useful tourist information was left in the room for us. Kiki and Tom are very considerate and helpful. <br/><br/>The location was brilliant, right in a very interesting and fun area with markets, vintage shopping, restaurants and nightlife. Also a few great coffee shops.<br/><br/> Felt very happy coming and going from this peaceful base. "
34935,874627,21-01-2012,1549707,Richard,"comfy, private, and clean, with great hosts. What more could you want."
34935,891884,30-01-2012,1626605,Isabelle,"Tom and Kiki are very nice, warm and welcoming hosts. Their place is very nice and clean, as on the pictures. Great with the ensuite bathroom! We got our own key, so we could come and go as we liked. The area is nice too, with lots of (indian) restaurants and bars. It's about a ten minute walk from different tube stations from where you get quite quick to most of the places of interest. The only negativ thing is that the room is right next to the street and we heard people and cars at night. Even for this the hosts were prepared and offered earplugs. They also gave us tips about where to eat or how to get cheap musical tickets."
34935,903951,06-02-2012,1297112,Gwendolin,"Our stay at Kiki & Toms place was very convenient. The room was cozy and the bathroom clean. The heater didn´t work the first night but Kiki fixed it right away. They also answered all our questions about London and gave tips for our stay. Another plus is the dog hendrix, he is very sweet and fluffy. The area is superb, very close to brick lane but in a nice and safe house in a side street. All in all a very nice stay, and an excellent value for money for London."
34935,915587,12-02-2012,1626146,David,"Tom and Kiki are very kind and accommodating.  It was totally cool to roll up during the day while they were out and cook myself up a delicious meal using their kitchen & all of their supplies.  Their dog, Hendrick, is friendly and well-behaved, and will assuredly be very happy to meet you.  Price was also reasonable and the neighborhood is a cool spot.  The guest room I stayed in, however, was not ideal.  The wireless internet was spotty (only in the room; worked fine in the living room).  To greater detriment, the room directly bordered the sidewalk and there was no noise insulation whatsoever.  I had difficulty sleeping because of the noise level.  Sounds from vehicles, pedestrians (esp. those in heels), and drunken idiots at 5 in the morning were inescapable, in spite of the provided earplugs.  Nice bathroom, though."
34935,945403,24-02-2012,1558382,Tabea,"We had a great stay at Tom and Kiki's apartment. Unfortunately we didn't met them because they were abroad at the time of our stay but they provided us with all useful information before our trip and we stayed in mail contact while we were there. <br/>the room was clean, spacious enough for two people and had a modern stylish bathroom en suite. the rest of the flat was beautiful as well.<br/>the flat is located very well. the area around brick lane is young and interesting with lots of nice shops and restaurants.<br/>we would definitely come back and hope to meet Tom and Kiki next time :)"
34935,966539,03-03-2012,1683946,Danis,"The room is very cozy and feels like a separate flat because of private barhroom. Unfortunately I was in a rush all days I was staying with Kiki and Tom. Hope I had more time to chat with them. They are very nice couple.<br/>Nights seemed a little too noisy because the nighlife in the area is boiling hot. I found earplugs on table when kindly provided by hosts =)<br/>There is lot to see around the area if you are looking for some hip urban experiences. <br/>Overall I'm totally satisfied. 5 stars."
34935,987489,11-03-2012,1638449,Anne-Sophie,"I can only support the reviews before: Everything is great (room, area, hosts), except the noise from the street (even if it is in a side street)."
34935,1023166,20-03-2012,215318,Yanitsa,"The apartment was very cosy and clean; the neighborhood is very lively and full with nice coffee shops and restaurants (not too expensive as well)..Tom and Kiki were very helpful and great hosts. The only drawback was the noise on the street, especially on the weekend.  Overall a great place if you are coming to London for partying:)<br/>"
34935,1031940,22-03-2012,1681195,Emily,Tom and Kiki were very welcoming! Their flat was was clean and modern. The only complaint was the street noise that seemed to be directly outside the window in the wee hours of the morning. Earplugs were provided.
34935,1077160,03-04-2012,1161954,Malcolm,"Tom & Kiki were wonderful hosts and have helped us in countless ways with our logistics at the start of our honeymoon trip. The room was neat, tidy and well furnished. There is plenty of wardrobe space and one can enjoy a rain shower after a long day outside. However, as the room is located beside the street, it can get a little noisy, especially over the weekends.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Malcolm & Jolene"
34935,1167142,23-04-2012,812723,Leland,"My partner and I had a very nice stay at Tom and Kiki's large, comfortable apartment in Shoreditch. Despite being a bit far from the Tube, it is very convenient to the buses on Bethnal Green Road and Shoreditch High Street/Bishopsgate. Overall the location is great--prime Shoreditch area, with plenty of bars and restaurants within close walking distance.<br/><br/>The only downside to the front room is street noise--the windows face right out onto the sidewalk--but I slept through every night except Saturday night. Vendors come in the middle of the night to set up for the Sunday market, and this is noisy, but I knew it was coming so it wasn't a big deal."
34935,1183691,26-04-2012,1722266,Chrystina,"The room was really lovely and clean -- very modern appliances and fixtures. There is plenty of closet space for your stuff too. Tom and Kiki are both very kind and welcoming, but also gave me plenty of privacy. <br/><br/>I was staying there on a work trip, and it was great to be able to go ""home"" after a trip rather than to a hotel. There were other visitors staying in other rooms, so if you wanted it to be social, it could be."
34935,1251924,09-05-2012,1778890,Mia,"We had a lovely stay at Kiki and Tom. The room was clean and everything is there, what you need.<br/>The two are also very nice and helpful. The next time we will go to London Trip definitely back again to Kiki & Tom. We felt very comfortable. Especially if you come ""home"" the dog welcomes you very friendly."
34935,1361808,28-05-2012,1974339,Sharon,"We went to London for the first time just to get away and see some new things. I knew as we checked out the streets from the cab that we were in a really cool, unique and trendy part of town. Then we went to Yummies where Kiki left us the keys. The guys at Yummies (an excellent cafe) welcomed us and were SOOOO nice. We ate breakfast there every morning. Then we went in and met Kiki who made us feel very comfortable and answered all of our questions. The place was spotless and the room was incomparable to a hotel. It was better! Exceeded expectations. Not to mention we got our own bathroom. Which ive never been in a nicer bathroom than that. Spitalfields is a the coolest Burrough and we did not want to leave. We fell in love and will Definately return. Amazing hosts in a really fun area. Don't Hesitate."
34935,1395570,01-06-2012,572259,Matthew,"Great place, good people, cool dog. Highly recommend staying here!!! A+++"
34935,1430779,07-06-2012,122830,Sharron,"Tom and Kiki were very gracious hosts. The room was clean and the bed comfortable.<br/>Kiki responded readily to our needs--being older, we needed a non-slip bath mat, which she immediately purchased; she used her computer to make the reservation for the taxi to take us to Heathrow at the end of our stay; she searched for and found a luggage scale which we had mentioned would be helpful in our packing.<br/>We were quite interested in the diverse cultural milieu in the Brick Lane area.<br/>We found transportation handy--the #8 bus running regularly into town a few blocks away on Bernal Green Road. One of its first stops is Liverpool Street station on the tube, which we used on one occasion.<br/>Overall this was a very satisfactory place to spend our post-cruise last four days in London."
34935,1489659,16-06-2012,1320670,Nadia,"Tom and Kiki's place is in such a great location - only a few minutes walk from Brick Lane - but that the fact that the Ens-bath street side room I had, and the apartment itself, were even better than expected was an added bonus. It's spacious, clean and very well organised. Additionally Kiki went out of her way to make sure everything ran smoothly and even tried to help me out at the last minute when I realised I had somehow booked a day short of when I needed to leave. Others mentioned it, but I didnt really notice any train noise, earplugs were supplied anyway. Highly recommended."
34935,1503288,18-06-2012,663061,Ludo,"Spent a weekend in London while staying at Tom and Kiki's apartment. The room is great, with a good bed and large bathroom. Location is also perfect, close to central underground station. Tom and Kiki are really nice people, with Kiki making sure that I had everything I needed. Recommended!"
34935,1539554,23-06-2012,1609821,Jennifer,"Tom & Kiki are lovely hosts, as is their well-behaved dog (Hendricks? Sorry to the little guy if I got it wrong). Their place is comfortable and spacious with a really nice outdoor area. The best part for travelers - they are located in one of the hippest neighborhoods in London. Tom & Kiki sent an email before our stay with really helpful advice about transport, house stuff, etc, also some excellent recommendations for restaurants, galleries and shopping. <br/><br/>We stayed there for the first 1/2 of our trip, and kept returning to the area because there is so much to see and do. Visit the Sunday up-market at the Truman Brewery, it's really a site to see (not to mention a good place to get amazing street food of every possible variety, and great vintage clothing finds). <br/><br/>Be sure to check out the fabulous St. John's Bread & Wine, Hawksmoor, and this great, inexpensive Vietnamese place in the Boxcar shops by Shoreditch Tube station, Hop Namo.... <br/>"
34935,1573887,27-06-2012,2198901,Esteban,"Lo mismo que dicen todos: Este cuarto es muy ruidoso. Tiene un buen baño y la cama es comoda, pero el ruido de la calle es molesto. Esta bien ubicado, pero si volviera a Londres iria mas cerca de la city o de South Kesington. Todo depende de lo que cada uno quiera."
34935,1609437,02-07-2012,2188333,Kat,"We had a great stay at Tom & Kik's! The room and ensuite were lovely - very clean, spacious and modern. Although we did not meet Kiki, Tom was very friendly and accommodating. The flat is also in a great area, on the doorstep of Brick Lane, with lots of cafes, bars and nice little shops and markets in the area, it's also only a 5 minute walk or so to the nearest tube station. The only down side if anything would be that it could get a bit noisy early in the morning with the window open, but this was not too much of a problem. Overall definitely worth staying here!"
34935,2033965,19-08-2012,3133486,Pia,"We stayed at Tom and Kiki's for 4 nights. The area is super cute with lots of vintage shops and cafes. They were very flexible with our check in and check out times, answered any questions we had about the area or how to get a taxi to the airport. We were able to come in and out of the apartment late without disturbing anyone as the entrance to the room is in the front of the apartment. Very cute garden in the back, unfortunately we weren't able to use it because we were alway out. Very cute dog! The windows do look out onto the sidewalk so be prepared for that-- late night passersby or if you want the window open you'll be at eye level of the sidewalk. They provided earplugs in case the noise was a problem and a fan to cool off the room. We came in August and the weather was surprisingly warm! It did rain once though and Kiki let me borrow an umbrella. :) Once you get the lay of the land, there are plenty of places to go out nearby and transportation nearby as well. I felt like a local by the end of the week. Overall a comfortable, laid-back and local experience which is exactly what I was looking for. "
34935,2240196,09-09-2012,2985548,Sarah,"My husband and I stayed for four nights in September. The location was perfect - easy to get to trains, buses and the dozens of cool bars/restaurants/markets in the area. <br/>We were provided with a very detailed pdf before arriving which had all the ways you could get there from each airport (with maps) and recommended bars, restaurants, things to do etc. <br/><br/>Bed was really comfy, but you will need earplugs if you're a light sleeper. Noise isn't too bad though - the room has windows out onto the street and occasionally there were loud groups passing the window that might wake you. <br/><br/>We were able to leave our bags there after our stay as our flight wasn't until 10pm. (very very appreciated!)"

34935,2561617,09-10-2012,3386644,Jo,Thank you Tom & Kiki to accommodate me for the need to arrive early and get the room prepared although there was an overlap with another guest before. The room is comfortable and clean. It's a 15 minutes walk from Liverpool Street Station but it's fine because there are some nice coffee shops nearby and I will stop by before continue with the walk. It can be noisy as early as 6 AM on a Sunday morning because people are setting up stalls just outside your room. Ear plug is provided if you are a light sleeper. Overall a good stay!  
34935,2587012,12-10-2012,3168873,Michael,"Great location near Brick Lane - very friendly hosts excellent room and beautiful en-suite bathroom for our stay.  This room is a bit noisy but other than that could recommend it highly. Note that the hosts Tom and Kiki did supply ear-plugs for those that found the cosmopolitan location a bit noisy at times.<br/><br/>Excellent transport close by. Great Stay."
34935,2641257,17-10-2012,1546848,Susann,"Unser Zimmer bei Kiki und Tom war nett möbliert (allerdings aus Platzgründen ohne  Sitzmölichkeit ). Es hatte aber angenehmerweise ein eigenes Bad. Wir wurden sehr freundlich aufgenommen und konnten einen ansprechend eingerichteten Wohn-Küchenraum mitbenutzen. Uns gefiel die Lage der Wohnung sehr gut, die Informationen zum Erreichen der Unterkunft und über die Umgebung waren sehr, sehr hilfreich und passend. In der Tat war es dort durch Straßen- und Bahnverkehr und sonntags durch Marktvorbereitungen recht laut (wurde ja auch schon in anderen Bewertungen erwähnt) die Ohrstöpsel wurden gleich mit ins Zimmer gelegt ;-). Uns hat es insgesamt gut gefallen."
34935,2665539,20-10-2012,1405142,Edward,"Tom and Kiki were fantastic hosts, couldn't of been more welcoming and  helpful, they went above and beyond what was expected. They were also great company. Location is great as you're pretty much at the heart of London. Close to Liverpool Street Station is a big benefit too. Some really good Indian restaurants nearby. I'd highly recommend a visit and stay!"
34935,2685390,22-10-2012,498042,John,"excellent location and nice apartment. just off Brick lane if you want to be where young london happens. Only neg is that the bedroom can be noisy especially for a sunday morning when a market sets up outside in the middle of the night. Lovely pub just down the road full of friendly people. Kiki also provides you with pages of useful local info. If you would like an unusual cinema experience try the Audin Cinema in Shoreditch , bit expensive but intimate and cosy.Great location for a great part of london and we didnt even use the tube"
34935,2780105,01-11-2012,3796334,Nadine,"Nous avons passé un séjour très agréable et avons été très bien accueillis pas Kiki et Tom. La chambre est très agréable et la salle de bain indépendante idéale. Nous reviendrons sans problème chez Kiki et Tom lors de notre prochain séjour à Londres. De plus, c'est très bien situé, proche des transports en commun. Merci à Kiki et à Tom pour leur accueil."
34935,2808204,05-11-2012,3518062,John & Mags,"A great stay in a great location! Room spacious, bed extremely comfortable and lovely big ensuite. Tom and Kiki are relaxed, friendly hosts and extremely welcoming, whilst allowing guests to have their own space and freedom to come and go. Great recommendations from them for places to eat and see - Meraz is a must! And of course there is Hendryk the dog! We'd stay again, even if only to spend time with him! xx"
34935,2965556,26-11-2012,3758517,Herrman,"Located very close to Liverpool street it is not hard to get around London when you stay with Kiki and Tom. The area is also really nice, just be ready to be woken up really early on a Sunday morning since there is a market right outside the house on that day.<br/>Tom and Kiki were also very helpful, we forgot some stuff and just asked them if we could borrow theirs and they were more than willing to help us. <br/>Finally, Hendrychs their dog is one of the cutest things I have seen. He wont get in your way and you'll want to spend time with him. "
34935,3058352,11-12-2012,3877850,Sara,"We spent a wonderful time in London! The flat is really beautiful and Kiki was so nice. We really recommend it. The house is near Brick Lane, a very trendy area in London. There's a bus stop about 300 mt. and with the no. 8 you'll reach the centre in just a few minutes. Just a bit noisy because of the near railway station but with earplugs we slept very well.<br/>We will surely book it again!<br/>Sara&Luciano from Italy"

34935,3362021,17-01-2013,573851,Stephanie,"Staying at Kiki & Tom's apartment was much like staying at a hotel but nicer – the bed was extremely comfy and having an ensuite was really nice. The room was a great size and was easy to feel at home for the few nights that I stayed there. Kiki was a lovely host and was great to have a chat with. The apartment is located just a few steps from Brick Lane, so exploring the area was really fantastic and very easy. Being so close to the train line made it really easy to get to the apartment and to other parts of the city. Would definitely recommend this apartment. Thanks again!"
34935,3392978,22-01-2013,1870383,Jean Jay,"Tom and Kiki are wonderful. I came to london for work (Account Manager at Airbnb) for a week and they welcomed me very warmly at the door with their nice dog Hendryks (by the way Hendryks is so funny...). Very accommodating about the time of my arrival because I was stuck in Paris so they welcomed my friend before I came .<br/>The house is large and full of warmth, it really feels like home. I have the opportunity to sleep in two rooms they put  to rent and I can say that they are very nice.<br/>In the neighborhood, you will find everything  in less of 5 minutes walk.<br/>I recommend Tom and Kiki strongly if you want a true experience in London."
34935,3416182,26-01-2013,4614728,Sarah,Tom and Kiki are amazing! They were such a wealth of knowledge and super friendly! The rooms are everything anyone could need and just like the pictures on the site. The location is closely situated to the city center and well connected by public transport. Glad we stayed with them!!
34935,3442111,30-01-2013,4327979,Maria,"The house is very nice and trendy. The room is very confortable, big and nice too. Kiky was really kind and generous. The locación was great. We did come back at night and feel secure. I really recomend the place. <br/><br/>Is true that the room is a bit noisy because is next to the street so you can hear from people steps to laughs and all kind of street noises. I sleep well so there was no problem to me. :)"
34935,3459414,02-02-2013,2658346,Arjan,"Excellent place for a stay in London in general and Shoreditch especially.  Nice clean room.  Friendly, hip area, although it can be a bit noisy.  All you need (restaurants, shops, entertainment) close by.  Haven't met Tom & Kiki in person but all communications were pleasant and effective."
34935,3487809,06-02-2013,3188869,Claudio,"Kiki was very responsive with all inquiries and provided a lot of information and resources for our trip to London, including places to see, how to get around and info about the apartment.  She provided enough info to probably save you a few hours in planning your trip.  She was also very accommodating with check in and check out.  <br/><br/>The apartment is in a very cool location, with a lot of street markets, bars, restaurants, bakeries, all within a short walk.  It's about a 3 minute walk to several bus lines that will take you just about everywhere in London.<br/><br/>The place was very clean and comfortable with a private bathroom and open living room/kitchen with everything you could possibly need. The other room in this apartment is on the opposite end so there is plenty of privacy between you and other potential roommates.  <br/><br/>Overall, an awesome stay, but I will mention the room faces the street and is on ground level, so you may hear foot traffic and cars if you're a light sleeper.  Also, the Sunday market sets up directly outside this apartment starting quite early, however, this market ended up being one of the highlights of our trip with tons of food and vendors all within a short walk! <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone!<br/>"
34935,3580637,19-02-2013,3340025,Marta,"hi,<br/>our stay ar Tom and Kiki's place has been super. <br/>The house is very clean and perfectly located, 1 min from Brick Lane, close to vintage shops and fashion/design laboratories. <br/>We only met Kiki and the funny dog.. so nice! <br/>Kiki has been a great host and has helped us in everything. I've asked her for an air dryer and after 10 seconds I had it!<br/>I hope we'll go back to London soon. And for sure we'll go back to Kiki's place!<br/>i truly recommend it!"

34935,3682021,04-03-2013,268730,Nerissa,"Tom and Kiki's place was a great place to stay in London. Staying at her place made us feel more like locals and less like tourists. It is close to Liverpool St. Tube Station which made getting to anything we wanted to see in London a breeze. The apartment itself is nice. I loved the bathroom. The bed was very comfortable. Kiki was very helpful with getting any problems sorted right away, and Hendriks the dog was very cute. I would recommend Tom and Kiki's place to anyone who wants to stay in a lively and happening neighborhood while also being close enough to get quickly into the city center.  "
34935,3814181,18-03-2013,2349756,Marc,"We had a very pleasant stay with Tom & Kiki, the place is very well located in the heart of Shoreditch/Brick Lane so it's easy to find stuff to do around or to reach Central London. The place was also clean and everything was ready when we came, they even provided earplugs as the street can be somewhat loud on weekends. <br/>I'd highly recommend it to anyone!"

34935,4203797,18-04-2013,4547686,Paula,"Our stay was very comfortable and we enjoyed the very quiet and well behaved small dog Hendrix. We found the #1 front bedroom, right off the street, to be quite quiet but did make use of the earplugs which were thoughtfully provided. The location was brilliant in the vibrant up and coming Shoreditch area, the new high tech area of London. Tons of great restaurants at every price point just around the corner and a quick walk to transit of all kinds. The bed was ultra comfortable with tons of storage space and lovely bathroom."

34935,4542573,12-05-2013,2199522,Rita,"Tom and Kiki's place is ideal for a short stay in London. Close to several tube stations and within walking distance of some great restaurants and attractions. The room is light and airy, ensuite is fabulous. We saw very little of our hosts, as they are very busy people and we were out and about, but they were extremely helpful and we would wholeheartedly recommend this place."
34935,5076659,11-06-2013,5041425,Christina,"Our stay and Tom and Kiki's place was wonderful.  Although we never got to meet Tom, as he was traveling for business at the time, Kiki was an amazing hostess and provided us with everything we needed.  Weary and fatigued from travel, Kiki greeted us with a smile and glasses of wine! She made us feel at home the entire time we were there.  <br/><br/>The flat itself is located off one of London's most famous party streets, Brick Lane.  Fortunately, Tom and Kiki's flat is just far enough down Cheshire Street that it is away from loud noise, which, for a light sleeper like me, is very important.  She even goes so far as to provide earplugs just in case there is any disturbing noise from neighboring streets.<br/><br/>This was our first time in London, and Kiki was excellent in helping us navigate the city and suggesting fun things to do.  <br/><br/>Overall the experience was fantastic.  Thank you, Kiki!"
34935,5150927,15-06-2013,995857,Òscar,"A really nice room in Shoreditch, one of the most interesting neighbourhoods in London. The apartment is big and clean and the room, with an ensuite bathroom, is great. Definitely, a perfect place to call ""home"" after a long day in London."
34935,5204886,18-06-2013,4772734,Rebecca,"Unfortunately Tom & Kiki were away during our stay so we didn't get to meet them. Kiki had provided us with some info about the area which was useful. The location was ideal for us.<br/>The downside is the noise - they supply earplugs for this reason! We heard people walking past in the street and trains going by. This didn't bother my husband but I had a couple of sleepless nights cos I'm a light sleeper.<br/>Overall though, Tom & Kiki's place suited our needs."
34935,5359728,26-06-2013,1549494,Jocelyn,"Very useful information about the flat and the area provided by Tom & Kiki, but we were not lucky enough to meet this lovely couple in person though.<br/><br/>The flat is very facilitated and nicely decorated. A lovely place to stay in. However, it was a bit noisy, coz the flat is just next to road, but they provide eye plugs. So, we were able to get some good sleep."
34935,5687150,11-07-2013,6286174,Marion,"Very central, quite close to tube.  Lots of restaurants around and easy to walk to Liverpool Street Station.  Down stairs room a little noisy, but some ear plugs were provided if required.  Everything was as described.  Hosts were very friendly and happy to help with any questions. Lots of space to hang cloths.  "
34935,5706834,13-07-2013,5010621,Brittni,"Tom and Kiki were lovely, along with their puppy Hendryks :) Interesting area filled with a variety of vintage shops, restaurants, etc Close to street as mentioned, and ear plugs provided :) in our case, we needed to catch the very early Eurostar the following morning and were unfortunate enough to have a bunch of people drinking at our window using the window sill as a bar till late night. Im sure this isnt a usual thing but along with the general street noise, made it hard to sleep. Great place to stay for those up late :) Thanks!"
34935,5794250,16-07-2013,7168932,Melli,"Nice and clean room with bathroom ensuite, 10 min walking from Liverpool St.<br/>Would definitely book it again!"

I especially liked the big living room which had all things needed. During our stay for one week, we've done laundry as well. Very convenient. And our room was quite nice and cozy. Highly recommended! Thanks Kiki & Tom!  "
34935,6054384,28-07-2013,7221898,Anders,"Really enjoyed my stay at Tom & Kiki's place. Communication was excellent and they made sure I could arrive at a convenient time. The house is located close to an overground railway line which surprised me at first but I ended up sleeping fine, even without using the supplied ear plugs. Room was very clean, had lots of storage space and the ensuite bathroom was marvellous. Only small downside is that my room was located at street level, so opening windows to let in some fresh air could only be done when present and awake. Used the kitchen and washing machine, and enjoyed some meals in the nice and cozy backyard. The living room was spatious and clean, although I've hardly used it  because of the fine weather. You can tell Tom & Kiki are putting in effort to make their guest feel welcome and at home, and I could really reccommend them!"
34935,6345676,09-08-2013,4905409,Albin,Correspond parfaitement à la description. La chambre et sa salle de bain sont très bien agencées et parfaitement propres. Le quartier est super. Kiki est disponible et de bon conseil pour votre séjour ! Je recommande !
34935,6427730,12-08-2013,1850499,Anna,"We had a wonderful stay in Tom&Kiki's apartment and can definitely recommend it to anyone looking or a central (well, central in Shoreditch...) place to stay! Since we love the area, the location was perfect, the room was super clean and Kiki was really helpful as a hostess. We didnt get to meet her in person but stayed in contact via Email to arrange key pick-up, leaving arrangements etc. We would definitely come back! Also, the street noise some people seem to be bothered by is really not that bad. If you dont sleep until midday, you will hardly notice anything. We didnt use the earplugs that were provided :)"
34935,7163994,09-09-2013,5900447,Kara,"Staying at Tom and Kiki's was everything we'd hoped for.  The location was great, the room was cozy and tidy and the bathroom was clean and modern with a great shower! Tom and Kiki were also very helpful with directions and recommendations. "

34935,7521452,23-09-2013,3305630,Joël,Super accueil. La chambre est spacieuse et autonome avec sa salle de bain.  Super quartier pour sortir. L'hôte est très prévoyante et ne laisse rien à hasard c'est vraiment un plaisir !

The room was clean and comfortable with a nice bathroom. Kiki was a great host and very helpful. We would definitely recommend the flat! "
34935,8335522,26-10-2013,2747677,Justine,"Kiki's place is very nice. The room is large and very nicely decorated. The attached bathroom is also nice and convenient. Everything was spotless when we arrive. <br/><br/>We had not understood that the room is on the ground floor and has direct view on the street so we were a little surprised and the noise from the street was quite loud. Fortunately Kiki provides earplugs so we managed to sleep well. <br/><br/>The coffee place where I should have picked up the keys was closed when I arrived but Kiki managed to find a solution and I got the keys one hour later. <br/><br/>Overall I recommend Kiki's place.

The room and bathroom were clean and great to stay in. Kiki was a great host, she helped us when we had questions and was very nice to talk to during our stay. And their dog is so cute and friendly. We would stay here again. "

34935,9.7673E+17,09-09-2023,208303456,Joanna,Property was exactly as pictured and in a great location. Would definitely recommend!
34935,9.86149E+17,22-09-2023,535211334,Glen,"Good accommodation, for the price, in a great part of London, with Brick Lane & Shoreditch on your doorstep and the City of London within 10 mins walk. Good local connections to the underground at Aldgate & Liverpool St, and overground trains & buses. Accurate photos of the flat, comfortable beds & the hosts were available to respond to any issues within an hour. There are train lines directly behind the building but this didn’t impact our stay unless the windows were open, and this is central London so there is always some ambient city noise regardless of where you stay. Would recommend, and would stay here again."
34935,9.93415E+17,02-10-2023,220319439,Beatriz,"O apartamento é bem espaçoso, cozinha equipada e roupas de cama bem limpas. Localização longe do centro, mas já estávamos cientes e utilizamos o metrô. Comporta 4 pessoas confortavelmente."
36299,126573,25-10-2010,238713,Ray,This is a very nice house in a very nice neighborhood.  The five of us had an enjoyable weekend.  Kew Gardens is a bit out of town but no trouble to get to on the Underground.
36299,218177,05-04-2011,427486,James,"Lovely house, great location with convinient transport links.<br/><br/>Host provided us with some food and drink upon arrival and was very friendly, helpful and overall a joy to deal with.<br/><br/>Will definitely use again."
36299,231819,19-04-2011,443197,Jennifer,"This is a wonderful location. This house is in a lovely neighborhood, has a nearby train station,grocery stores,tow path along the Thames and is within walking distance to Kew Botanical Gardens. Geert was very helpful and made himself available to answer any questions we had regarding our trip. We highly recommend! "
36299,349094,03-07-2011,445777,Edwige,"We had a wonderful stay.  Geert was really nice and always available via email for any question we had.  We were ideally located with easy access to the Tube.  We loved the little ""village"" around the train station and enjoyed having breakfast outside in the garden!  The house was impeccable.  We definitely recommend it."
36299,360214,08-07-2011,590605,Bodil,"We were delighted with the house that Geert provided. Everything was very clean and the house was fully equipped. The beds were excellent and apart from the airplanes on their way to the airport it is a very quiet location. The proximity to the tube, buses, restaurants and shopping centre was perfect. We did not get a chance to meet with Geert but he stayed in touch throughout and we never felt abandoned. It is a perfect location for those who want to visit London but still get a ""real feel"" for the city and how people live there"
36299,480574,28-08-2011,573127,Ursula,"Definetely the best place to stay in London, especially if you love Kew Gardens as I do ! Going to the city is no problem, and after a long day of sightseeing relax in this nice neighbourhood. Great for running along the Thames!"
36299,831005,03-01-2012,635825,Panos,"We had an ideal stay at Geert's house. It is well located, outside the bustle of central London but only 5 minutes walk from the underground. The house is spacious, more than enough for us (a family of four). Geert was perfectly responsive; although we did not meet, everything was laid out for us in advance, and we never felt at a loss. Very organised and clean, a very pleasant experience."
36299,1233481,06-05-2012,1829820,Gina + Azeem,"We rented Geerts house for 5 days. We were lucky to be able to park the car right out front and I enjoyed my walks to the tube station through the pretty neighbourhood. It was a fine connection to get into central London and lovely to go back to a peaceful neighbourhood at the end of the day. I also found it super convenient that the Kew Retail Park with a Boots, Marks & Spencer, Mothercare, and clothing shops, was a short walk from the house.<br/>The house it self had all the conveniences that we needed. We were staying there with 5 adults and a baby and all had a comfortable stay, and it was nice to be able to stay in a proper home and not a hotel. <br/>Geert was a very friendly host, he was reachable and provided a handy  booklet with information about how to get to the tube station, how things in the house worked, etc. This was our first time staying somewhere using airbnb and it was a great experience!"
36299,1355696,27-05-2012,1963701,Nancy,"We had a lovely four day stay. Kew is adorable and Geert was a great communicator from the moment we booked.  imaculate home, pleasant walk from the station, half an hour from central London attractions.  We wouldn't  hesitate to stay the again."
36299,1399080,02-06-2012,2065711,Amanda,"This house is a lovely place to stay for the location (close to the Thames River path, Kew village and London transport) and the comfortable accommodations. Back garden is a bonus for children, as well. Geert was extremely responsive to all of our questions and took great care to ensure we had a great stay. We hope to be back again before too long!"
36299,1424734,06-06-2012,285813,Anna,Lovely place in a lovely area - highly recomended.
36299,1573514,27-06-2012,2085281,Dave,"Fantastic -- exceeded my (already high) expectations! :)  <br/><br/>What can I say -- everything was exceptional -- from all the email correspondence with Geert leading up to the trip, right through our departure. Geert played, not only, host for his place but as  host for London tourism -- supplying lots of information on how to get about, places, to eat, etc...  And an excellent ""things to know"" guide about his place -- how to work appliances, what to do in emergencies, where all the keys were, etc...<br/><br/>I, along with my family, had the pleasure of meeting Geert on our arrival and he made us feel like we were friends coming back for a visit rather than strangers showing up for the first time.<br/><br/>The house is great -- as is the location. Geert's recommendations for food were spot on. Well -- you get the gist and I'll just run out of glowing adjectives. :)<br/><br/>Thanks Geert!!"
36299,1946157,11-08-2012,661952,Steve,Geert was an excellent host and the house was just as described.  Fantastic experience for my family.
36299,2036260,20-08-2012,722790,Sarah,"Had a wonderful stay at Geert's house in Kew.<br/><br/>We hired the house for a base for my family to stay in over my wedding weekend in London - couldn't have asked for any better - beautiful place, lovely garden and perfect me to get ready in on the morning of my big day.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this house to anyone wanting to explore the area.<br/><br/>Thanks Geert.<br/><br/>Sarah & family"
36299,2096955,26-08-2012,1630091,Maya,"Lovely house. Very close to Kew Gardens which are beautiful and great for small kids. Very easy access into central London.<br/><br/> Can get a little noisy due to the airplanes and trains but anywhere in Kew would have the same issue."
36299,2603308,14-10-2012,2919605,Amber,"We loved our stay at Geert's place and he was immensely helpful with info as we travelled from Australia with our two boys.  We would definitely return to his lovely, perfectly located place. "
36299,2790912,03-11-2012,3281785,Bodil,We had an excellent time at Geert's house. Although we did not get to meet in person he was available to contact at all times and made us feel very welcome. The house is immaculate with comfy beds and good size bathroom and kitchen. Location is excellent with underground and bus only 10 mins walk from the house as well as easy access to the airport There is good shopping close by and the house is situated in a quiet street. I would really recommend staying here if you are visiting London!
36299,5574994,07-07-2013,4932933,Stephanie,"Geert's place was absolutely fantastic.  The location was within walking distance of the Tube, a post box for our postcards, a shopping center and the national archives.  The home was clean and fit our family of five perfectly.  The backyard was nice for us after a long, noisy, busy day in London.  The children enjoyed the backyard playground.  Geert was always quick to respond to e-mails or phone calls with any questions or concerns (we only had one after we arrived as Geert had provided us with maps, tube information, etc. so we didn't have any questions or concerns after we arrived).  I would stay here again and again.  Perfect!  "
36299,5862829,20-07-2013,2318477,Flaminia,"Our stay in Kew Gardens has been great! The location is excellent, very close to the tube station and the river. Wonderful walks along both the river banks! The house is really beautiful and comfortable. Geert is a perfect host, making you feel welcome and assisted. He kept in touch to be sure we were fine and answered readily our emails. Its info about the house and how to move around is perfectly clear and complete. He left us every kind of useful London guides and maps, and provided also essential breakfast. Lovely place to stay, all of us wish to be back in kew soon! Thank you very much, Flaminia & family"
36299,6803034,26-08-2013,4289057,John,"There were 5 adults in our party and we stayed at Geert's house for 9+ days in August 2013. The house is located on a quiet street and there was plenty of room for us. The beds were very comfortable. Geert's description and pictures are very accurate. There was no need for us to rent a vehicle. We used the Underground and Rail services to all our destinations. The Eastbound side of Kew Gardens Underground has a wonderful array of local stores that we found very convenient. There's a butcher, health food store, 2-3 restaurants, Starbucks, pub, barber, and so on. There are ""Retail Shops"" within a 5 minute walk of the house. All your food and basic needs are available within a 5 minute walk of the house. Also, Kew Gardens is really quite a beautiful area.<br/><br/>Should you decide to rent a vehicle, be aware that there is only parking on the road and it's very limited. Also, the house is on a flight path, so you will hear planes flying overhead. However, it didn't bother any of us at all.<br/><br/>Geert is very familiar with London and is able to provide you with directions and tips. Be sure to use his expertise. He speaks an number of languages fluently and is easy to communicate with. He is very helpful.<br/><br/>This was the first time we rented via airbnb.com and we had a very positive experience.<br/><br/>Thank you Geert."
36299,8532165,04-11-2013,9258374,Birgit,Geert is a very good host. The house was just perfect for our short stay over the weekend of Halloween. It is very beautiful and well kept and the location in Kew Gardens is very convenient.
36299,9535520,02-01-2014,7215716,Grant,"Such a lovely house - felt like home almost immediately.  The kitchen is fantastic and is well accommodated for cooks.  All the rooms  are large and comfortable and the house is perfect for a family. The location is great - close to the walking paths along the river, 10 minutes from the tube and train station and just around the corner from a great retail park with a large Marks & Spencers and Boots.  We also appreciated Geert's detailed instructions and responsiveness - he was incredibly helpful before and during our stay.  We are definitely going to stay there when we're next in London!<br/><br/>"
36299,12602097,06-05-2014,9299773,Mirjam,"We really had a great and comfortable stay at Geert's house in Kew. Whoever is interested to be in a more personal atmosphere than a hotel and to have a bit more space (especially with children), this is a place to recommend. The house is well equipped and in a good and nice area - close by the railway station, shops etc. Geert was really helpful right from the beginning of the communication. Even though we did not meet in person, he is a great host and very easy to deal with. Thanks a lot Geert! "
36299,14388817,18-06-2014,13275131,Dee," My first experience of Airbnb, and it was a great one. Geert replied immediately to our booking request and it was easy to set everything up. <br/>I took my 93 year old mum, who is very fit, but a hard task master when it comes to finding a comfortable bed. Geerts house passed with flying colour's!<br/>The descriptions were accurate and Geert left a very detailed and accurate info pack in the house. <br/>Great for Kew Gardens and easy to get into town. Would defiantly go again."
36299,16342262,26-07-2014,14930200,Mary,Geert's home was as pictured. It was clean and very pleasant.  Our family felt safe and comfortable there.  I would not hesitate to recommend this listing.
36299,19788351,18-09-2014,20559298,Jean-Michel,"Great house, and the band had a very pleasant stay. Beautiful neighbourhood."
36299,22167676,31-10-2014,22774260,Lee,"Great place to stay for a family. House ideal for what we needed with two teenagers and a toddler. Great location - really safe and nice area with good local amenities - shops, restaurants, pubs - but also very easy access to public transport into Central London. Host Geert kept in contact throughout to ensure our stay went smoothly. Would stay here again. Have never used Airbnb before but experience has been infinitely better than using a hotel and being cooped up in a room for twice the price."
36299,23894723,14-12-2014,15647065,Leonie,Geert made us very welcome by leaving very clear instructions for absolutely everything we could possibly want to know about his home & the local area. He also left a much appreciated box of chocolates!  We soon found our way around the local area - including the beautiful Kew gardens. 
36299,24326442,26-12-2014,22991059,Tricia,"Geert was a fantastic host.  He was very accommodating on arrival and departure times.  He responded promptly to all of my questions.  He also provides a welcome packet that answered lots of my questions.  His home is also very cozy.  A few points to consider -- the street is very narrow if you are considering driving.  The house is also near a train track - which after a day or two I no longer noticed.  His descriptions of the size of rooms and beds is also accurate - some are small, but serve the purpose.  His photos are also accurate - the main sitting room consists of a couch and two chairs with no tv.  All this said - it is in a great location. Easy walk to Kew shops and train.  Quiet street and great neighborhood."
36299,24846640,03-01-2015,11488327,David,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and Geert made it an excellent one from start to finish.  We have a family with three young children, and it made all the difference in the world to stay in a quiet residential neighborhood on the edge of London rather than in a hotel.  It really felt like ""coming home"" every night, a much better experience for the family.  The property is very well kept, in a nice neighborhood just a short walk to the tube.  There are a few restaurants nearby in Kew Gardens, and we found a great variety of excellent places to eat in nearby Richmond (5 min or so by car, bus or train/tube).  <br/><br/>What really set things apart was how friendly and helpful Geert was throughout the process.  He was very responsive to messages and went above and beyond to offer lots of helpful advice to make our visit to London more enjoyable.  He provided a very useful ""house manual"" with practical advice on the house as well as public transport and local sights, along with a number of local pocket guidebooks that helped us daily as we planned our excursions with the kids.  Most notably, we encountered some unexpected maintenance closures on the tube during our visit and Geert emailed me back before the next morning with several detailed maps and suggestions for alternate ways to get too and from central London.  What could have been a major headache on our holiday was no problem thanks to Geert's timely and practical advice. <br/><br/>If you do drive a car, it is worth noting that there is ample on-street parking in the neighborhood, and Geert was kind enough to arrange in advance for resident day parking permits for us to use.   For days that we traveled into London, we relied on public transportation and bought day passes which were a great value and allowed unlimited use of tube/bus/train.  <br/><br/>Throughout the experience from booking to departure, Geert took a genuine interest to see that we had a nice holiday and enjoyed our stay at his house. "
36299,26902939,22-02-2015,173167,Katharine,"This is a lovely place in a fantastic neighborhood. Geert was a very responsive and helpful host, and always got back to us within a few hours when we contacted him. He took care of everything, and we loved staying here!"
36299,29966380,15-04-2015,25001869,Rosy,"We needed a place to host a group of 5 adults and a baby and this flat was an excellent choice. Communication with Geert was very fluent and easy, the description and pictures were very accurate and Geert left a very detailed booklet with instructions which was very helpful. The fact that there is a garden was amazing for the youngest guest.<br/>The area is lovely and there are many stores and restaurants around. Commuting to and from Heathrow airport and to city centre is very easy. Overall a fantastic experience, I would highly recommend it.<br/>"
36299,32121894,14-05-2015,1827444,Cathrine,"This was a spacious and comfortable home, Geert was welcoming, flexible, and easy to communicate with. Would recommend."
36299,32957213,24-05-2015,13486820,Carrie,My family of five really enjoyed our time at the house! The amenities allowed us to pack lightly and proximity to the gardens was fantastic. Hampton Court Palace is just a 30 min bus ride away. Geert's instructions were thorough and very helpful. 
36299,39730670,26-07-2015,27738460,Scott,"Geert was an excellent host. All through the booking procedure Geert responded to messages very fast. When we arrived at the house there was a little booklet that Geert had prepared that clearly explained how to work various things and also give useful tips about the neighbourhood and suggestions of things to do while staying. Geert very kindly gave us a gift of New Zealand wine when we arrived (we are from New Zealand). After a long flight it was gratefully drunk!<br/><br/>The house was very comfortable and we felt immediately at ease in it.  Good location in beautiful Kew and close to a tube station. Would recommend this as a good place to stay while in London. Comfortable and secure. "

Welcome pack was waiting for us on the kitchen table, with instructions, maps and parking information. 5-10min walk to Kew Gardens tube station, 15min walk to Kew Gardens Park. 5min walk to a large shopping area (clothes and food)."
36299,73186333,07-05-2016,50920790,Carl,"A fantastic apartment which was perfect for our needs. Geert left a welcome note, which included some local tricks and places to eat, and followed up on how we were settling in. Highly recommended."
36299,77231439,30-05-2016,20762745,Iain,"Geert's house was a brilliant place to explore the Kew area. Kew Gardens were amazing and the house is in a perfect location for walking everywhere. Close to the tube for access to central London, plus local pubs, restaurants, parks and of course the river. Car parking wasno problem. <br/>The house was immaculately clean, beds really comfortable and everything as described on airbnb. Geert was a perfect communicator and we would not hesitate in coming back !"
36299,80688056,19-06-2016,63644178,Troy,"The home was even better than our high expectations from the previous reviews.  Starting with a thorough set of instructions on how to operate the home, touching base during the stay and a welcoming Milk & OJ which our kids pounced on at 11PM when we arrived.  Clean, welcoming, great part of Kew, easy to access for trips into the City of London.  Geert's home was a fantastic stop on a long trip allowing our kids and us to recharge!  We could not have hoped for a better spot.  "
36299,83856773,04-07-2016,7796347,Jennifer,This house is very well located close to Kew Village and the river. It's a great base for exploring Richmond and all of London. I would really recommend it!
36299,85856985,13-07-2016,63589823,Deepak,"We stayed here for 5 nights. We wanted to get a feel of living near the river and parks in London. This stay helped us in achieving just that.<br/><br/>The house is quite near to the Kew gardens and 2 minutes walk to the river Thames. On the days we wanted to go to central London we used underground, for which station is at walking distance.<br/><br/>The house is quite nice with 3 bedrooms which suited perfectly for our family of 4. The house is quite airy and has good natural light. There is a large private garden.<br/><br/>The entire area is quite green and walk up to the river Thames is also quite scenic. Plenty of birds are audible and visible. Occasionally we see cats (and a fox once) - which my children loved.<br/><br/>Even though it is in a quiet residential neighborhood, super markets and shops less than 10 minutes walk. Reasonable pubs and restaurants are within walking distances.<br/><br/>The kitchen is quite large and well equipped. Utensils and cutlery are high quality. One bathroom is proper size. One toilet is quite small. One caution that there is no storage space for the guests.<br/><br/>Geert has provided plenty of information quite methodically in a set of printouts that made our stay quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay here."
36299,89913424,30-07-2016,14114714,Thomas,Geert had everything ready and was very helpful explaining everything in a very useful guide. The house was very comfortable  and great for getting in and out of London while staying in a calm neighbourhood. It is a great option for a family stay.  We stayed with our three  youngish children. 
36299,121317558,16-12-2016,86174331,Juliette,Geert was very responsive and also extremely accommodating on check in and check out times which was very helpful.  House is in a great location and is very clean. 
36299,123260217,28-12-2016,7817511,Adam,"Great house, lovely location, perfect for our needs. Shame the TV and DVD system did not work, but could not fault the home and would definitely stay again."
36299,161171538,17-06-2017,22488024,Christian,This is a wonderful property. Kew is a lovely place and this house is perfect for small families. The kitchen is gorgeous and well equipped. A M & S within 10 min walk. 
36299,167351179,06-07-2017,3010918,Sandra,"Great location, kid friendly, has everything you need! Geert is super friendly, responsive and accommodating. There is also now a TV available which is connected to broadband.  "
36299,171848139,19-07-2017,14571578,Chantal,"Excellent location in quiet, peaceful part of greater London. Wonderful to stroll amongst the deers at Richmond Park and to visit the new ""Hive"" in Kew Gardens. We were particularly fortunate to have stunning weather which we could enjoy in the garden of the house with our children!"
36299,180030082,09-08-2017,40625567,Kate,"We had a wonderful stay in Kew Gardens while in town for a wedding thanks to Geert. The house was spacious, well-presented, and equipped. My husband and I have lived just down the road for nearly a decade so it was wonderful to be back in familiar surroundings in such a comfortable home. Would highly recommend!"
36299,182393481,14-08-2017,132475086,Ron,"Great house close to Kew and Richmond. Quiet road, no through traffic, but trains and planes can be heard. We had a good stay with a small baby."
36299,195355273,19-09-2017,42374462,Jim,"We had been looking for a house that allowed the flexibility for the family that was flying in for the wedding later in the week. This seemed to represent the location, location adage.  It's very useful that whilst parking is a premium, there are times other streets need to be used. But to be honest thats no great shakes, with the only periods been a voucher system, which Geert helps with. Upon arrival the house was presented as clean and ready to use. Information pack on the dining table. If your there the walks with kids are great. Getting into central London is a doddle with Kew Gardens station a walk away. Surrounding the station plenty of facilities and if all  else fails theres a retail park as well. Getting used to been under the flightpath is a novelty.  Everything is at hand to use should you prefer to cook at home. We tried eating out and eating in, and enjoyed having both of these options. If you need a lovely location or visiting Kew Gardens then I can't recommend enough Geert a very communicative host, thanks for the welcome beers!"
36299,199500914,02-10-2017,5073713,Juan,"Great place, wonderfully quiet neighborhood. All three of is enjoy our stay. The place is set up perfectly.   Its a quick drive into central london and there were plenty of food and drink options a short drive away. I'd recommend this place to everyone. And the hoat Geert was quick to reapond to emails."
36299,249421792,02-04-2018,121984788,Jennifer,"Geert was a great host, very responsive to queries, lots of information on the house and area.  Felt very welcome and comfortable in the house.  It’s not in the central tourist area, but was really quick to get anywhere you wanted (we were at the Museums quicker than our friends staying in Hyde Park).  Has many more amenities such as shops close by that made it convenient - and a quick escape from town on our day trips out West.  Our teenage children didn’t ask for the wifi password for over two days!!!"
36299,291136149,15-07-2018,130249739,Ruediger,Very nice house for a family or friends who want to stay in the lovely neighborhood of Kew / Richmond to start the journeys from there. Tube connection to London Underground is 5-10' walk. Nice host who responds quickly. We had a wonderful time there being 2 couples.
36299,297741055,28-07-2018,159118206,Leane,Great location and Geert provided detailed instructions and was amazing at getting back to us quickly with any questions.  
36299,305569877,11-08-2018,204239000,Graham,"This house was in a great location for a family trip to London, with the underground/overground trains only a 10 minute walk away. Plenty of space for a family of four and lots of local amenities within a short walk. The Kew Gardens Inn/Pub served excellent food, and gin. Kew Gardens itself was only a 15 minute walk away and is a day well spent."
36299,310277705,19-08-2018,87069756,Marty & Melanie,"Geert's home suited us really well with a young family. Geert was super responsive, helpful and full of advice. The location is great close to Heathrow and rail stations in west London, easy to get into the city centre. Kew Gardens is within easy walking distance (must see) as is the Thames. There is  big M&S close by for food. Proximity of the rail line and Heathrow flightpath may be a consideration if you are a light sleeper. "
36299,324544707,17-09-2018,12417092,James,Geert’s house is a gem. It’s stylish and cosy with a lovely little back garden and a great dining kitchen. It is only a short stroll from Kew Gardens and the tube. Geert was a really helpful and friendly host. We had a really lovey family holiday staying in his home.
36299,328543248,26-09-2018,90766436,Michael,Beautiful house very well situated. The stay was very comfortable and the host very accommodating and thoughtful! I will definitely stay here again.

36299,355231789,03-12-2018,52766231,John,"I stayed at Geert's place with my sons and a friend in December 2019. Geert's communication before and during our stay was excellent. The house is as described - well located, clean and with all essential amenities.  We can also recommend the Buenos Aires steakhouse in Richmond, which is really good.  Thanks Geert for a great stay!"
36299,364195415,30-12-2018,216750397,Kornelius,Very nice and relaxing location in the suburbs of London

Tube is only a  5 min walk to district line station . It was the perfect location that our family of 5 needed. Communication with Geert was always easy and he was super flexible to adapt to our needs of schedule and check in and check out time. He provides a booklet with All the info about the house and the area. I hope his place is available for our next trip to London.  And thank you for the little present it was delicious!
36299,474736607,23-06-2019,167691813,Jennifer,"Period house in a great location for visiting Local area attractions ( National Archives and Kew Gardens) and convenient for public transport routes by rail, bus or boat!<br/>Great host who is very helpful and communicative.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay and hope to visit again soon."
36299,479631146,01-07-2019,250644756,Sara,Great location to explore Kew Gardens and easy access to London with tube station nearby! Great flat with lovely backyard space. We enjoyed using this as our base for exploring the London area.

36299,492444516,21-07-2019,2893663,Christian,"A wonderful house to unwind after a day in the centre of London. Recommended for families; Geert‘s house was very well equipped with everything we needed. We especially liked the location: Kew „village“ as we called it is a great place to explore, and the walks along the Thames are very peaceful. Thank you Geert for your advice and your flexibility with check-in times!"
36299,503600626,06-08-2019,99305224,Silvia,La casa di Geert è molto accogliente e confortevole. Ci siamo sentiti come a casa. Pur essendo lontana dal centro è ottimamente servita dai mezzi pubblici. Zona tranquilla e residenziale
36299,521925485,01-09-2019,2362757,Claire,"The house is in a great location, friendly, local area, comfortable, clean house, feels like a happy family home, full of lovingly restored furniture and interesting books."
36299,540301357,03-10-2019,54900526,Daniel,"We had a terrific stay at Geert’s place in the early autumn. This is a nice place with 3 good sized bedrooms and one large bathroom, with a convenient downstairs half bath. The location is excellent, about an 8 min walk from the Kew Gardens station and there are several nice restaurants within a 6-10 minute walk. The backyard was nice to look at, but since it rained often during our stay we didn’t spend any time enjoying the yard. The kitchen had all the appliances and utensils needed for cooking meals, and there was also an office and a cozy front living room to spend time in as well. Hotly recommend."
36299,554468099,26-10-2019,160629721,Kartikay,"Absolutely amazing place. It far exceeded all expectations. Geert was helpful with communication, the space was clean, and it was close to the National Archives!"
36299,556677043,30-10-2019,131901657,Mark,"The house was spotless when we arrived.  A great location, just a short walk from Kew Gardens station. Close to the rail line but that didn't bother us in the slightest.<br/>The house has everything we needed and there were detailed instructions for the appliances written in a way that made us smile. There was also a helpful guide to local shops bars and restaurants.<br/>We would definitely stay there again."
36299,655376406,23-08-2020,362897376,Hrh,"If you want to stay in a nice part of London then this ticks the box. Just be prepared that this place is not a typical holiday home. It’s the owner, Geert’s home which he vacates for the duration of the stay, or at least this was the case for us. It wasn’t really set up for a family holiday as such as the house was very much actively still being lived in by Geert. It was quite cluttered. There wardrobes were full of his clothes, the freezer and part of the fridge stocked with his food and the living room was set out for him with no way for us all to chill out, as there’s just one sofa and a few metal dining chairs in there. Also be aware that it’s in the Heathrow flight path and very close to the train line. It’s quite noisy and expect to woken up early. Parking is fine, if somewhat tight, with people not leaving much space and the road is safe. During the week, a permit is needed for your car. Geert provided us with these for the two days we needed them. <br/>Geert seems like a nice chap and communicated well. He had alluded to the fact the place needed some TLC and there was a bit of clutter in one area but I wasn’t quite prepared for the reality. It was very expensive overall and the £100 partial refund we received, although very much appreciated, didn’t quite seem enough to make up for the discrepancy in what we were expecting versus the reality of what we found."
36299,659027742,31-08-2020,55887247,John,Gorgeous house in beautiful location. Great communication and geert went out of his way to make sure trip went well for us. Would definity stay again

36299,4.8096E+17,25-10-2021,195133120,Nicola,"A great location for exploring this part of London. The house is located on a peaceful, safe street, just 5-10mins walk from Kew Gardens tube station. We are used to quiet rural living so we did notice the nearby railway line and planes, but that is only to be expected for London!! Highly recommend Geert's house for a comfortable stay in a great location."
36299,4.95466E+17,14-11-2021,26617035,Paweł,Geert was super helpful with all sorts of guidance and very responsive. We had all the directions ahead of the trip and which made everything very comfortable. The house was very clean and well equipped - we had everything we needed for a great stay!
36299,5.05649E+17,28-11-2021,304119828,Bryan,The house is very well connected. A few minutes from the Kew Gardens tube station. There are some nice walks close by along the River Thames. Parking spaces were in good supply in the culdesac where the house is situated. The house is very clean and warm. It has very good amenities including dishwasher upstairs and downstairs toilet. The kitchen looks out through double doors onto a nice garden. All the rooms are a very good size and are very pleasant with interesting pictures on the walls. Communication with the owner is excellent. He clearly cares that guests have the best experience. I would thoroughly recommend a stay here

Exactly as described, very close to shops/buses/underground. <br/>Really nice touch having a high chair and option of travel crib too. Our 9 month old started crawling in this house, so it will always be special to us. Will absolutely stay here again when we come back to see our family in Kew. Geert’s communication was quick and friendly, recommend it to anyone thinking about going to the area :)"

The house was easy to access and his parking accommodations were a huge reason we chose this place. You can hear planes and trains but we got used to it in one nights sleep. We felt very safe (we are not from or particularly comfortable in big cities) within the Kew area. Geert’s tips (in his listing description) on how to get around London were also helpful, I knew if I needed anything I could just ask. The washer and dryer was also a big plus!"

We would recommend them to anyone who wants a comfortable place to stay. House is very close to the Metro (tube). No problem at all. Agri is a great resource for any questions about London. Breakfast was 5 Stars, room very clean, beautiful patio and backyard. We stayed 2 days in October 2010. My wife and I are even planning a trip with our children within the next year and we would return to the same place if it was available. Thank you again Agri!!!"

Location is great, 5 minutes by foot from the East Finchley underground and bus stop (18 minutes with the tube to the center of London), a lot of shops and meal opportunities (fast food and slow food, plus 2 big and cheap supermarkets) right outside the door.<br/>What can you ask more? The kindness!!! Agri and his husband are GREAT, helpful and funny people, always ready to help out with every tourist need, and at the same time with the discretion needed to hold an acommodation.<br/>The room was big, ultra tidy and with a delicious view to a relaxing garden. There were also adapters for the UK power socket! And the breakfast was delicious, handmade scones and everything you could think of will help you start the day in the best way, even if you get up a little later :-)<br/>All in all you could not miss this, and I hope to get back here my next time in London!"

36660,124569,22-10-2010,252263,Randy,"I had a WONDERFUL stay. I DEFINITELY recommend staying with Agri and Roger. Agri was out of town when I stayed but Roger and Agri's sister, Fibe, took excellent care of me. I have nothing but positive things to say about my stay. The home is charming. It is easy to get to their home from the tube. Agri gives excellent, precise, directions once you've confirmed your reservation. <br/><br/>Roger and Fibe were amazing hosts and made me felt like I was coming home again rather than staying somewhere I had not been before, which was the case.  I had not yet stayed there. My room was immaculate with a very comfortable bed. There is a huge, beautiful backyard; it is a wonderful home. I was welcome one evening to watch a soccer match with Roger in the living room. It truly was like a home away from home. The neighborhood is very nice as well.<br/><br/>My last morning I had to leave very early, about 5:15am, and Fibe got up that early to make me coffee. I was truly spoiled. <br/><br/>If you have the chance to stay with Agri and Roger, I recommend doing so 100%!"
36660,125913,24-10-2010,258088,Umar,"Was a great experience, wish I had stayed longer! The host was very kind and respectful."
36660,130059,30-10-2010,253067,Patricia,Agri is amazing and that is why I picked her place a second time around.
36660,130724,31-10-2010,238955,Phil,"Very nice time - well run, clean and friendly place to stay - thanks for a pleasant stay. Highly recommended"
36660,131225,01-11-2010,252028,Jesper,"We had a fantastic stay with Agri and Roger.<br/><br/>We felt at home and relaxed in the house and Agri served a very nice breakfast every morning. We will definitely be back another time. "
36660,133409,04-11-2010,258341,Matthew,"Agri and Roger were great hosts.<br/>Very sweet and accommodating with a lovely, peaceful setting.<br/>I'd definitely stay there again when in London. <br/>"
36660,134554,07-11-2010,235601,Mallory,"Agri and her husband were godsend's during our stay. They were our last stop after 2 weeks of traveling, and it was great. Agri was incredibly kind and thoughtful - going above and beyond anything I would have ever expected. The house is very comfortable, the garden is lovely, and it's very easy to get around thanks to their proximity to the underground.<br/>My sister and I loved staying here, and definitely recommend it."
36660,135211,08-11-2010,254489,Basak,"The lovely house of Agri and Roger was our first Airbnb experience. It was absolutely much more than we've ever expected. A perfect, big, clean, very well organized room filled with everything you may need + a breakfast that includes anything you may want with an impressing, very British style of dish set. Both Agri and Roger are very helpful and they definitely enrich your stay with their advices about the city and the neighborhood! I wish we could stay more than a night. But at least now we know where we will stay whenever we are in London!"
36660,136829,10-11-2010,261828,Steve,"I am a Professional Consultant with my own company and I am always looking for quality deals for accommodation, believe me, you will not get much better than this, it is undoubtedly one of the best places I have stayed in London on this site, its almost perfect, Agri is very welcoming and wants to make you feel at home right from the start, I would stay there again anytime.<br/>Steve<br/>"
36660,137662,12-11-2010,267801,Marcos,"Fantastic trip! I only had the chance to stay for one night, but i enjoyed the stay and the fords' hospitality. I had a large bedroom with desk and great view outside. Agri was fantastically warm and welcoming and made me feel at home instantly.<br/><br/>The house is a quick walk from the tube stop which is near a great pub as well!<br/><br/>Compared to other places i've stayed in central london, this was a superlative choice and at a fantastic price. Had i the opportunity, i would have spent more of my stay here. Would highly recommend to others!"
36660,140642,17-11-2010,216243,Lone Kathrine,"I highly recommend a stay with Agri and her husbond. They are both very friendly and helpful. The rooms and sorroundings are very nice and clean and comfortable and the breakfast was simply fantastic - served with tea or coffee made just the way you prefer it :-)<br/>I stayed for 6 days and was happy with everything. The only little thing that one might be a little unhappy about is that it takes about 25 min with the tube to get to the center of London - but then again, what does that really matter. If I go back to visit London again I will defenitely stay here!"
36660,141824,20-11-2010,127457,Valentina,We spent more days in Agri&Roger's home and they were great!!!
36660,144745,26-11-2010,275120,Ralf,"I had the pleasure to enjoy Agri's place together with my wive for a three-day London trip. We felt very welcome by Agri and Roger.<br/>The room was very nice and clean - just to feel like home. Breakfast was great and the house is close to an underground station with direct connection to the city centre - ideal for everyone who wants to discover the highlights of London.<br/>We can recommend Agri for everyone who is traveling to London. They are just great!<br/>Thanks Agri and we will make sure to book with you for our next trip to the wonderful city of London.<br/>"
36660,146157,29-11-2010,255465,Florian,"It was a fantastic stay. The room was as discribed very beautiful and the breakfast was more than I expected and therefore great too. I would recommend staying there. There's no problem with zone 3, it took us 22min. to get to the city. "
36660,148928,05-12-2010,257830,Anne,"I have stayed with Agri and Roger for nearly 1 1/2 months while relocating to London, and it has been an absolute pleasure all the way.<br/><br/>Agri and Roger are probably the nicest people in the world. They are wonderful and helpful and instantly make you feel welcome and at home. It's easy to tell that they both enjoy having guests in their house. And don't even get me started on the great coffee and Agri's delicious homemade scones...<br/><br/>The house is beautiful with views to a nice garden, the rooms are big and comfortable and true to the pictures. It's a 5 minute walk to the station and from there direct access to Central London with Leicester Square only 20 minutes away by Underground.<br/>"
36660,153366,13-12-2010,309156,Sarah,We had a lovely stay with Agri and Roger. They were perfect hosts and made sure we were well looked after. It was so nice to stay in a home after weeks on the road - a great change from hotels and hostels. Their house is just beautiful and in a great location with easy public transport links - not too far out of the city centre but far enough to catch your breath and enjoy a little peace and quiet. Ideal also if you are coming o going from Kings Cross St Pancras. Will def stay again next time we are in London and would recommend to others.
36660,155573,19-12-2010,241103,Linh,"Agri and her husband are lovely hosts who not only let us use their home but really welcomed us and made our time in London so enjoyable. Their house is really cozy and warm, they provided us with internet access and gave us really detailed instructions on how to get to their home and even picked us up. Breakfast was delicious, but it is their warm and welcoming personalities that makes staying with them so worthwhile!"
36660,159318,28-12-2010,280449,Ania,"Agri and Roger are a wonderful couple!  They will make you feel like part of the family when you stay with them.  Our room was great, very spacious, comfortable bed, TV, etc.  The house was beautiful and located very close to the metro which was only a 25 min tube ride to Leicester Square.  They had a wonderful table with breakfast prepared every morning!  My boyfriend and I stayed here over the Christmas Holiday and they even prepared for us a traditional English dinner!  They are really amazing hosts and I would DEFINITELY recommend staying here while visiting London.  Thank you very much Agri and Roger, hope to see you (and Brian ;) soon!"
36660,160787,31-12-2010,230993,James,"Staying withAgri and Rodger was just like being at home.<br/>we both felt extremely happy to have been treated so well as this was our first experience of an Airbnb place to stay and theirs was our first of a series of short stays in europe for the first time ever .<br/>Coming all the way from New Zealand we had a little apprehension and this was totally disapated as soon as their door was opened to us.<br/>A nicer couple will be hard to find and should we ever visit the UK again ,we will know where to stay for sure.<br/>Thanks again Agri and Rodger and other guests."
36660,162786,02-01-2011,316627,Jamie,"Agri and Roger were very accomidating in our arrival time as well as making it possible to extend our stay they make you feel right at home and help with any questions you may have about London, the transit is real close and there are lots of shops and resurauts a short walk up the street..breakfast was delicious and coffe always fresh .. looking forward to my return stay when I bring my Husband.. thanks again for everything"
36660,165935,05-01-2011,275319,Stephanie,"This room was very spaciouse and clean, and breakfast every morning was excellent!  Also it is very conventient since it is very close to the underground.  It is about a half hour ride to get to downtown London on the underground."
36660,168798,10-01-2011,307778,Frank,"Agri family is a most lovely family that I have ever been with. Thanks for the very nice and warm hospitality for 3 days in London. I would like to visit again.<br/>"
36660,168900,10-01-2011,322304,Dawn,"I stayed with Roger and Agri for 2 night/2 days.  It was wonderful and I  wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.  I felt like family!!!! Their home is LOVELY and very close to the Tube.  It felt a LOT more comfortable than staying in a hotel.  This was my first stay with Air BNB and it was excellent.  I was nervous about getting lost, but it was NO problem.  Roger and Agri were VERY helpful in orienting me to London.  It was a wonderful weekend trip!"
36660,170371,14-01-2011,318566,Melanie,"After an extremely long transatlantic flight, I was exhausted and in need of some quiet and a long sleep. Immediately, upon walking into Agri and Roger's home I felt calm and right at home. Roger made me a lovely cup of tea and showed me my amazing room! Overlooking the garden, very clean and large. There were books to read, dvds to watch, had I not been so tired I would have taken advantage of the nice library in the room. The upscale neighborhood was very central (on the Northern line, easy to transfer to the Picadilly line to get anywhere if you are in London on business, as I was) and there was also wonderful food at a couple of the pubs I visted late night after my business meetings. Agri and Roger are the most lovely couple, and make any female traveling alone feel safe. Agri even lent me her umbrella for the weekend when I mentioned I needed to buy one. They are so sweet and I look forward to my stay there in a couple of weeks when I return to London again on business. I think I've found my permanent home when I travel to London! ps...try Agri's homemade scones...best I've ever tasted."
36660,172714,20-01-2011,325183,Nika,"I have found my new homebase for any visit I make to London!  Agri and Roger made me so welcome and comfortable from the minute I stepped in the door from a long train trip on a wet evening.  In minutes, I was comfy in the living room with a cuppa tea and conversation.  My room was ready, lovely and warm, with plenty of closet space, and the bath was just a step away.<br/><br/>Breakfast was so enjoyable each morning, with many food options, easy conversation and a gorgeous view of the back garden - this made a great start to each of my busy days on this business trip.  I also felt right at home tucking up in my room one day, just taking it easy.<br/><br/>Access to the tube station is a couple of minutes walk.  I ate in the Old White Lion pub next door to the tube several times and really enjoyed the menu offerings.  Close by, the high street offers cafes, shops and a small pharmacy.<br/><br/>Thank you Agri and Roger!  Your place is the best!  I've already recommended it to several friends and colleagues.  See you next time!"
36660,174638,25-01-2011,326364,Paola,"It was amazing to stay at Agri and Roger's house, they are adorable and warm people, yet very respectfull of intimacy. <br/><br/>The breakfast in front of the big garden is delicious, the room and the bed very confortable with all these details that make the difference (hairdryer, filtered water and glasses, many hooks, towels and drawers). <br/><br/>The whole home is welcoming and peacefull, and has the most adorable guardians, 2 cats, Brian and Bam Bam.<br/><br/><br/>"
36660,177527,02-02-2011,318566,Melanie,Roger and Agri are a delight to be around. This was my second stay at their B&B and I intend on making it my permanent lodgings whenever I come to London on business or pleasure. I met so many wonderful people staying there and it is such a warm and cozy atmosphere to be in. Feels like a home away from home! Thank you so much for the wonderful experience.
36660,178884,06-02-2011,138386,Isabella & Gary,Best place to stay in London!
36660,179501,07-02-2011,342669,Joe,"We stayed with the Ford family for three nights on our Euro Trip. (A first night in London then the last two nights, separated by a week). They were extremely kind people. We loved the cats and the homely feel. The one downside is it is a little farther from London proper than I would have hoped but it turned out to be a nonissue for us.<br/><br/>The breakfast was delicious and I also highly recommend eating at the Old White Lion."
36660,181036,12-02-2011,331873,Jørgen,"As soon as you enter Blenheim Lodge at Roger´s and Agri´s you feel welcome. They are very helpful and can answer any question you may have about London. Even in terms of transportation around town.<br/>The room is nice and large with a comfortable double bed. There is easy access to toilets and showers and it is clean and tidy everywhere.<br/>Thanks for a wonderful stay. We would like to come again.<br/>Sanne and Jørgen"

36660,199571,15-03-2011,335730,Miah,"A perfect home away from home when visiting London. Quiet, cozy, and very comfortable. Agri and Roger do their utmost to make you feel at ease and take very good care of you. Tasty, substantial breakfast; large, nicely decorated, and clean rooms with homey touches (like a big chair and vanity table); and an easy underground ride to the center of London. Loved my stay chez Agri and will be back soon!"
36660,201486,17-03-2011,407713,Deanna,"Agri and Roger are very accommodating hosts.  THis is a very nice, peaceful and beautiful place to call home when in the London area. Recommend highly.    "
36660,204452,21-03-2011,344256,Simone,"It's a beautiful house, with a lovely garden. Agri and Roger are very kind, I absolutly suggest this place, that is not far from the city center (15 minutes by underground). The breakfast is rich and the rooms are cosy and clean. You won't want to leave."

36660,214152,01-04-2011,275023,John,"This room lives up to and surpasses its guarantee! We visited in late March and the gardens of London were in full bloom, including the one at this place. We enjoyed the hosts who were very kind and the breakfast they provided was a spread to see. We recommend this place 100% to all manner of travelers."
36660,215033,02-04-2011,158660,Elizabeth,"This is the best Bed and Breakfast that I have ever had the pleasure of staying in on my travels. Roger and Agri have a beautiful home to share while visiting London! This is the second time I've stayed here, and I love it. It's my ""home away from home"" and I highly recommend it! Blenheim lodge is very clean, comfortable, quiet, cozy, and you couldn't ask for more hospitable and gracious hosts. I will visit again and again. :-)"
36660,218942,06-04-2011,158660,Elizabeth,"Blenheim Lodge is a terrific place to stay while you are visiting London. Agri and Rodger provide beautiful, welcoming, comfortable lodging and you will feel right at home. It is quiet and clean, cozy and warm. The location is great because the buses and the Underground and very close, and it only take about 20-30 min to get into central London. I highly recommend staying here, and have been here for two different trips to London. My mom loved it here as well! :-)"
36660,222767,11-04-2011,403969,Brigitte,"Agri and her husband welcomed us with afternoon tea.  Their hospitality was outstanding.  The accommodation is comfortable and very pretty.  We had had unexpected changes in our travel plans and Agri helped us find maps, did last minute washing and provided a very early breakfast.  She went way over and above what would be expected of a host.  We can't recommend her highly enough and we thank her from the bottom of our hearts.  <br/>Gitti and Michaela"
36660,224663,12-04-2011,404856,Travis,This is a lovely room with a beautiful view of the gorgeous backyard. All of Roger's tulips are in bloom and makes for a lovely experience. 
36660,225337,13-04-2011,227431,Gretchen,"A beautiful home with an even more stunning garden, two wonderfully friendly cats and amazing hosts! We loved our brief stay here, just a few minutes from the nearest tube stop and equally near an excellent pub with excellent food. Breakfast in the morning was also wonderful- especially the homemade scones! Our room was even outfitted with a nice big TV and selection of DVDs. Though a bit outside of central London (zone 3 rather than 1 or 2), I think the ride in to town would certainly be worth the incredibly pleasant stay!"
36660,226868,15-04-2011,335730,Miah,"We had a nice stay with Agri and Roger, though it was not as great as the previous visit. There were a few hitches, but the were fixed promptly. All and all, it was a nice place to stay, with easy access to all of London.<br/>"
36660,235222,22-04-2011,404856,Travis,This is one of our favorite rooms! The bedroom door opens up onto a lovely sitting area in the beautiful back garden. Very clean. Highly recommend this room!
36660,240808,26-04-2011,444168,Ajay,"Wonderful Host + Heavenly Accommodation + Fascinating Garden is how I would describe my short stay here. If possible I would never like to leave that accommodation but after all I was a guest. They are such an accommodating hosts to take care of minor likes / dislikes of their guests that Agri allowed my wife to make tea of her own liking and served me hot milk in breakfast. Agri ! we are really thankful to you for that gesture. Frankly, from previous feedbacks I was sure of a wonderful experience there but actual experience surpassed all my expectations. They are the best hosts I have ever come across in my life. Now we can't think of any other accommodation whenever we need to stay in London."
36660,247914,02-05-2011,452605,Roberto,"My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights at Agri and Rogers beautiful little BnB in London. Our stay was outstanding, with absolutley no complaints of any kind. Agri and Rodger were lovely and so were their adorable cats Bam Bam and Brian. Breakfast was always awesome and the metro is super close so it was easy to get around.If we are ever in London again we would definetly stay here! "
36660,250766,03-05-2011,548135,Bijan,"It was just fantastic - I did not have much time to enjoy the stay, but I really felt like at home from the second I entered the house. Everything is just lovely, and Agri and her husband are very nice people. Very good!"
36660,256267,09-05-2011,401803,Herbert,"My first reaction to writing this is ""awe do I  ** HAVE ** to tell the world about my new home away from home in London?"".  Agri and Roger were made for this.  Blemheim Lodge is close to the East Finchley stop and here's what you can look forward to: the absolute kindest hosts that you are ever going to meet in London. Don't get up and leave too soon to see the sights though, Agri puts out a wonderful breakfast for her guests and if you don't try her homemade scones, you are missing something spectacular. I truly cannot recommend Blenheim enough. Thank you Roger and Agri for having such a wonderful home away from home for me. I will stay no other place now."
36660,261661,13-05-2011,449377,Dj,"Next time I'm in London I will definitely book my stay at Agri's home.  The room was clean, comfortable and large.  Breakfasts were my favorite time.  The food was delicious and  several other guests would be there and we'd swap our best London travel tips with each other.  <br/>Agri also was very helpful with places to see as well.  Great place to stay!  <br/>"
36660,265382,16-05-2011,467229,Julie,"My friend and I stayed with Agri for 5 days.  We received a warm welcome and felt like we were staying with family.  We preferred not to share a bed, and Agri had another bed set up in the room for us. We booked late, but Agri was stlil able to accomodate us, by having us switch rooms once.  Both rooms were excellent.  The 2 rooms that we stayed in downstairs share a bathroom, but we didn't find this a problem.  Anything we needed, Agri was more than happy to provide.  She can tell you exactly how to get around as well.  Breakfast was great, with a lot of choices.  The tube station is a short walk (maybe 5-ish minutes) and the bus stops are even closer.  There is a grocery store just past the tube station.  I would definitely stay here again."
36660,272019,20-05-2011,507895,Alexandre,"Agri leaves in a beautiful house... It is realy like you can see on the pictures ! Not far from the centre of London, not far from the Tube, it is realy perfect. Agri is realy nice, we had a HUDGE breakfast, we didn't eat again before 3 pm What I liked is the fact that Agri host people since many years and you can feel that as soon as you contact her."
36660,273979,21-05-2011,586043,Oliver,"Had to make a last minute booking to stay in London. The price was great and as a result I was a little unsure about the quality.<br/><br/>Agri was very responsive beforehand with emails and was very prompt.<br/><br/>I received a very warm welcome when I arrived and I immediately felt at home!  The room was exactly as you see it in the photo, yet that doesn't include the great ground floor views of the garden.<br/><br/>The shared bathroom was on my floor and was never in use when I needed it.<br/><br/>Although I was there for one night, I was in and out of the city on the tube all the time.  Luckily all my stops were on the Northern Line and the nearest stop was an easy 5 minute walk from the house.<br/><br/>I'd definitely stop here again."
36660,289408,31-05-2011,240690,Laura,"Agri and Roger were extremely hospitable and made us feel at home during our 11 day stay. Their home was beautiful and clean. There was a nice breakfast spread each morning, and Agri went out of her way to accommodate our special dietary needs. The house is in a lovely area in northern London. The underground station is a 5 minute walk from the house, and it only took us about 20-30 minutes to ride into central London each day to sightsee. I would definitely stay here again in the future!"
36660,296477,04-06-2011,376572,Rachel & Ben,"Agri is such a welcoming host, and after a 24hr flight, being ushered inside to a cup of tea was pure bliss.<br/><br/>The rooms are a wonderful size, the house is gorgeous and has a history to it, and it is situated in a beautifully quiet area.<br/><br/>Agri's breakfast buffet is definitely something to NOT be missed - overflowing with options it was a beautiful way to begin each London day.<br/><br/>If you're after a place with friendly, accomodating and generous hosts, large and clean rooms, look no further."
36660,297796,05-06-2011,334414,Tammi,"We came back to Roger and Agri after a few days away in Bath, and were able to stay in another room at the Blenheim. This one was smaller, I'd say more cozy, but this time we got a visit from Brian, one of the house cats! We were so pleased as this was near the end of our long vacation and we missed our cat so much.<br/>The bed was so comfortable and Agri was kind enough to let us have breakfast a bit early so we could make our early flight. (Word to wise for those going to the airport ... remember that it takes 20-30 minutes to get from East Finchley to central London on a Saturday, then ANOTHER 45 minutes out to the airport!)"
36660,306831,10-06-2011,557036,Jay,We were made to feel welcome and at home while staying at Agri's place. She gave us lot's of useful  inside tourist information to make your getting around London easier and more fun. We will look forward to staying here again!  
36660,325001,20-06-2011,453020,Lisa,"My partner and I stayed in the in guaranted to love it room with the beautiful view of the large gardens. We stayed for short time and wish we had more time to speak with Agri, Roger and their lovely guests. The home is 'lived in', very clean and has a country feel to it. the room was next door to the large shared bathroom which again was clean. <br/>The area where the guesthouse is is lovely and has a great variety of eateries only about 5/10 minutes walk; infact we ate at a lovely south indian restaurant in the high street called cochin.There is a japanese, greek, italian and other restaurants locally.<br/>if we return to London again, we would most certainly return to stay at Agri and Rogers home.

36660,339463,28-06-2011,174439,Sarah,"I highly recommend this place! It's very well located, near the subway station which take you in nearly 10-15min in the main stations. The host are very kind and will help you if you need it! The place is juste lovely! The Breakfast is also a very good way to start the day, the view on the garden and the large choice of food and drinks makes it perfect! "
36660,358071,07-07-2011,338907,Barbara,"Agri and Roger were just delightful hosts, friendly, warm and helpful.  Well before I arrived in London, Agri had been helpful in every way with my queries.  <br/><br/>I loved my room with its exquisite garden view.  To be greeted by Agri at the end of the day with, ""can I make you some tea,"" made me feel so at home.  Her home was like a cocoon for me, which, as a solo traveler, I really appreciated.<br/><br/>The local pub, The White Lion, was a great place for dinner after a day of touring and the nearby tube got me into central London in 20 minutes.  Also, a 20-minute walk from Agri's and Roger's is Hampstead Heath, the huge, beautiful park.<br/><br/>In short, I could not have enjoyed my stay with Agri and Roger more and I would stay there again without hesitation.  I hope it's soon!"
36660,367965,12-07-2011,400176,Sharon,"The Blenheim Lodge was a great place to stay.  Walking distance to public transport, stores, restaurants, and laundry.  Agri and Roger are great hosts and are very helpful and welcoming.  Loved the homemade scones and conversation at breakfast.  Brian and Bam Bam (cats) were an enjoyable part of our stay.  We would stay here again when we return to London."

The room was spotless and so clean and fresh. There were books and magazines to read and a TV with freeview and DVD and so many small touches that it really had the warmth of a home from home. Agri is such a lovely host and it was so nice having breakfast with the backdrop of a wonderful garden to gaze at. The other guests were all delightful and I found breakfast a really interesting and relaxing time, hearing what everyone was up to for the day. All in all a true gem ... I'm not sure I should be telling everyone as I'd love to keep this place a secret find for myself!!!! Highly recommended and next to a tube station so you're in the heart of London at Leicester Square in 15 mins and then equally with the beauty of North London to retreat to. What more could anyone want."

The breakfast is wonderful as well. I got addicted to the coffee served. "

36660,2315641,17-09-2012,3177421,Lisa,My husband and I stayed at Agri and Roger's B&B 2 weeks ago for 2 nights and had a lovely stay. They were welcoming hosts and very friendly. We came in early Friday morning and they had a room ready for us and even gave us breakfast. The room was private and comfortable and very quiet. It was only a 5 minute walk to the tube and a 20 minute train ride to central London.We would highly recommend staying at Agri and Rogers's B&B and hope to return one day!
36660,2367523,22-09-2012,2021982,Gys,"Wonderful wonderful wonderful.  Although sadly Agri was away on holiday and we never got to meet her, we did get to meet her sister Fide and Agri's husband Roger.  Fide was extremely helpful and Roger was very friendly and always checked in on us to see if everything was OK.  The continental style breakfast was also wonderful and with more than enough food to choose from to start one's day.<br/><br/>A beautiful guest lodge, one we'd most certainly stay at again on our next trip to London.  We can recommend this place highly, so do yourself a favour and book with Agri and Roger, you won't be disappointed.  Agri and Roger's airbnb tag line of ""you're guaranteed to love this"" is spot on, in fact, a bit of an understatement.  You're more than guaranteed to love the place, in fact if you don't love it, I'll eat my hat!<br/><br/>Agri, thanks for the bubbly you left for us for our honeymoon, just sorry we never got to enjoy it, as we were out late most night, making the most of our short time (only 2.5days) in London.  A most thoughful gesture, thanks again for that personal touch!<br/><br/>We had the lovely ground floor garden room, opening up onto the patio, with a table and chairs outside our french doors, where we could smoke (as the lodge is non-smoking), so this was also wonderful.<br/><br/>Once again, thanks for an awesome experience!"
36660,2601896,14-10-2012,2587682,Julie,"I enjoyed my stay at Blenheim Lodge and this room was very nice.  It was spacious and the bed was comfortable.  It had a door opening out onto the garden with seating outside which was a unique bonus.  The bathroom with shower next to the room was clean and the breakfast room was cosy overlooking the lovely garden.  Great continental breakfast with cereals, toast, pastries, fruit, yogurt, juice, tea and coffee.  The hosts are lovely, Roger and his sister-in-law, Fide, looked after me and are very friendly and accommodating. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Agri as she was away overseas during my stay at the lodge.  The two cats, Brian and Bam Bam, were very inquisitive and liked all the attention the guests gave them.  The tube station is just a few minutes walk down the road and the Northern Line will take you straight into central London in less than half and hour.  I would recommend Blenheim Lodge to anyone wanting a nice, quiet, and welcoming place to stay in London."

The location is really convenient for going anywhere- just use the underground. The trains are frequent and the area is safe. It felt like a home away from home! Having an amazing free breakfast every morning was so convenient too! It's nice to be independent but also to be able to meet and share notes on what to do in London with other travelers staying there. We will definitely book again! We loved it!!!"

36660,3369515,18-01-2013,630446,Jean-Philippe And Christine,"Not a lot can be added that other guests have not already mentioned.  Agri & Roger were not around when we stayed at Blenheim Lodge, but their daughter Lana was more than welcoming, hospitable and provided some good tips.  The area around is lovely (Muswell Hill and the Parkland Walk) and it is really a short walk to the tube.  We would not hesitate to stay here again during any future visits.  "

The house is less than 5 minutes away from the tube, so it´s no trouble at all to go back for a little rest in the afternoon before heading downtown again for the evening (app. 25 min commute).<br/>We will definitely plan to stay there again!"
36660,3549401,15-02-2013,5007349,Adeel,"Agri and Roger really good with communication as they will update you with everything you need to know as soon as you will do the booking. We went there and been look after by their daughter as Agri and Roger were on holiday.  Room was very spacious clean and really nice view to the garden as they have a very nice well maintained garden very relaxing as bed was very comfortable. Next morning we had continental style breakfast wow really nice there was so much to choose, Toilet was very cleaned we really loved staying over there and hopefully on our next trip we will give our preference to stay again with Agri and Roger.  Highly recommended guys "
36660,3605823,22-02-2013,5023164,Tal,"We had a wonderful experience at Agri and Rogers home. They treated us like their own family. Their generosity was heart  warming.

And Agri came and picked us up from the train station when we got lost.   I would recommend their place and definitely say there again!"
36660,3888158,25-03-2013,4917395,Marissa,I very much enjoyed the short distance walk to the subway and the delicious breakfast provided in the morning! Their wonderful backyard was gorgeous covered in snow. The in-room tv's were a nice addition too. 
36660,4032018,04-04-2013,4975485,Gavin,"The place is few minutes walk from London tube East Finchley. The room is so lovely and clean. We felt relaxed after a whole day out sightseeing. In the morning, their cat slightly pushed the door and  entered our room as if to say hi, then looked around and left. I don't know about cats but somehow I felt welcomed by this gesture. I had a great breakfast: hot coffee, scone, toast with fresh jam, fruit salad...and left the house content and full of energy."
36660,4106233,10-04-2013,4954740,Peter," We enjoyed our say at Blenheim and nothing was too much for the hosts.  The room was comfortable. Thankyou for a wonderful stay.<br/><br/>Regards<br/><br/>Mary and peter"

36660,4403718,03-05-2013,5200189,Sue,"Agri and Roger were lovely gentle hosts who provided not only a lovely breakfast each morning, but advice regarding tips for  local places we needed to find. Their garden is gorgeous and we spent one late afternoon on the grass in Spring sunshine reading. The cats did think our room was also theirs, so you have to know they will visit you regularly! The bed was extremely comfortable, which was a real bonus too."
36660,4514573,10-05-2013,4602070,John,"Excellant, place to stay....I will stay again the hosts are wonderful and go out of their way to make your stay wonderful. If you are looking for a place to stay in London look no further.  The room was clean, the breakfast is Excellant and the beds are comfortable. Best of all is the price. The underground is close and there are resturants close by...  I already look forward to the next time I visit."
36660,4554313,12-05-2013,3627571,Gary,The room was clean and comfortable and Agri and Roger were very welcoming and couldn't be more helpful. I will stay there again when I go to London. Highly recommended. 
36660,4832690,28-05-2013,5687811,Laetitia & Laurent,"The place is calm. The house is lovely, with a beautiful garden. Our room was large, comfortable and quiet. Cherry on the cake : it's only five minutes away from East Finchley station.<br/><br/>Agri and Roger ? Perfect hosts ! Friendly, warm and they make your stay in London easier (advices, luggage, etc).<br/><br/>We definitly recommend staying there! <br/>"
36660,4898133,01-06-2013,4695289,Helen,Staying with Agri and Roger was like a home away from home. Nothing was too much trouble. Everything was comfortable  and clean. It is clear why they are rated super hosts because that is what they are. Our first experience at an airbnb was most enjoyable. Loved the beautiful  garden views and the fat pigeons. Breakfast was the best!!!
36660,4960756,04-06-2013,2989992,Betty,"Agri and Roger are most gracious hosts.  My room that opened onto the garden was perfectly lovely.  Agri even gave me a lift to the tube on my way to the airport.  They are only about 3 blocks from the tube, but the pavement is uneven, if you are bringing a rolling bag.  I highly recommend staying with Agri and Roger."
36660,5224691,19-06-2013,228660,Lynn,"We could not have asked for a better place to stay than with Agri and Roger at Blenheim Lodge. It is so close to the Tube, yet far enough away from The City that you really feel the distinct English charm that is East Finchley, thanks to Agri and Roger. Agri is one of the best hosts I have ever stayed with, and i've stayed with a lot. If and when I do return to London, I will unconditionally stay at the Blenheim. The room off the garden is wonderful and recommended to anyone so lucky to stay there.<br/>"
36660,5264873,21-06-2013,904898,Lindsey,"Staying with Agri and Roger was great! They were both so warm and welcoming and made my stay in London very nice. Agri even helped me when I first arrived by giving directions to their location off the tube stop. She gave me tips about how to get to the Chunnel when I left too. Also, my suitcase wheel broke and she offered to drive me to the tube stop when I left I would have an easier time. Helped so much! Thank you to both!"
36660,5392728,28-06-2013,5353229,Grant,"To me Agri and Roger typify the differences between the organic airbnb experience and the somewhat sterile experience in a hotel or hostel. They positively support, generously share, and are personally involved and interested in their guests having a fabulous time in London! I love East Finchley (where they live)...it's where the Underground comes out of the dark tunnels of central London and meets the light of day...literally! I'm vegetarian but it was no problem getting meals locally...Agri and Roger had several recommendations. Also they are no newbies to London and Agri often knows what bus numbers to take in North London and where to change to get where you want to go. Roger is an avid gardener and the landscaping of the property is beautiful...the view from my room was heavenly. If I go back to London next year there is no doubt as to where I'll be staying...my only hope is that they will have room for me as I understand they are already taking bookings into the middle of next year! My experience here was 5-star...and Blenheim Lodge is definitely my ""home away from home"" in London :)"
36660,5460213,01-07-2013,2312612,Romy,"Agri and Roger live in the british house like you imagine it in your dreams. The garden room where we had the chance to sleep was big, very comfy, clean and so pretty ! It's like a dream to wake up there, have a cup of warm coffee served by Agri, say hello to Roger and go drink it in ""your"" own part of the garden. Very very lovely way to start your day, even more when there's sunshine. We also took our breakfast in the common veranda and it was very pleasant, there's a lot of choice (and a lot of people, not very surprising for this marvelous place). The place is filled with flowers which is lovely. Everything is clean.I'd just warn people who have light sleep that the garden room is next to the bathroom so you'll hear people using it at all times, but it's not awful, I found sleep quite well anyway.<br/>At last I'd like to say that the hosts are very warm and always there if you need something, they'll help you with pleasure and give you tips for your trip."
36660,5522143,04-07-2013,502558,Barry,"Thanks Agri and Roger for a great few days spent in your beautiful home , the room was lovely leading onto a truly lovely English garden, the breakfast was second to none and the host were just perfect hope we will be coming again Barry &Brenda Australia "

36660,5673351,11-07-2013,4797412,Barbara,"We had a wonderful time at Agri and Roger's beautiful home.  We felt entirely welcome from the very first moments.  Lovely and gracious hosts.  The room was gorgeous, overlooked an amazing garden full of delicious scented roses and many other variety of flowers.  It looks just like in the picture.  The breakfasts were perfection.  Agri even drove us to the hospital as I had stiches that needed to be removed and had no idea where to go.  Caring and gracious above and beyond necessary.  The home is 5 minutes from the tube and we were downtown in no time.  Please, if you are planning a trip to London this home is a must!  Also, don't miss a meal at the Old White Lion Pub right next to the East Finchley tube...you won't be disappointed."
36660,5822413,18-07-2013,4624706,Alan,"Agri and Richard were wonderful hosts and their home a lovely place to stay. We had a lovely time there and met some lovely people. Situated close to tube and with a lovely graden, Agri and Richard di everything to make our stay a very pleasant one. We spent a lovely few days with them and would warmly recommend them as hosts to anyone looking for a place to stay in London.<br/><br/>Alan and Vivian"
36660,5882173,21-07-2013,1893749,Adriaan,It was a nice stay. Agri and Roger were very helpfull and the big glass with icecool water was very welcome after a hot and tropical day in London. We liked the conversation with the other residents each morning at the breakfasttable. A place to come back.
36660,6269592,06-08-2013,5357410,Bricet,"Agri and Roger were absolutely wonderful hosts.  We stayed at Blenheim Lodge for 15 nights and we thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Bam Bam, Brian, Garfield and Lelu were delightful feline companions.  The access to the backyard from our room was lovely, the room was large and tidy and the bathroom was large and just next to the room.  We had access to the kitchen to make cups of tea.  A beautiful continental breakfast was laid out every morning and we loved the fresh fruit salad!  Blenheim Lodge is ideally located only 5 minutes from the East Finchley tube station on the Northern Line.  I was sick while I was there and Agri and Roger looked after me like I was one of the family.  I really appreciated it.  We very highly recommend Blenheim Lodge and will certainly stay there on our next visit to London."
36660,6366314,10-08-2013,3180969,Kira,"Agri & Roger were wonderful. The room was just what it looked like in the picture and the bed was comfortable. We didn't end up using the small patio but the room had a door that opened onto the patio and overlooked the garden. The breakfast was continental but very large with a range of pastries, fruit, yogurt, and cheeses; it was lovely.<br/><br/>Agri gave us a ride to the tube on the day we left, even though the tube is very close, a seven minute walk. Agri and Roger were incredibly hospitable and went above and beyond to welcome us and help while we were staying and even after we left. I received a package after I left that Agri forwarded on to me. I couldn't thank her enough. I would definitely come stay again."
36660,6419805,12-08-2013,6642384,Sharon,"The room advertised was exactly what was described: a lovely, quiet, private and spacious place to come 'home' to in London. Agri and Roger are warm, helpful, and easy going hosts. I loved staying with them and found the garden, which is enormous and private, such a wonderful,relaxing retreat. The location is convenient to the tube, and there's a great local pub with excellent food called The Old White Lion. All in all a terrific stay. I wish it had been longer. "
36660,6555235,17-08-2013,2749709,Sandip,"Agri and Roger were wonderful hosts to us. We spent maximum days in UK with them and they made our stay memorable. Their place is very near to the station and had a wonderful garden overlooking the breakfast table. Breakfast provided was wholesome and delicious every morning which made a great start to our day. The room we stayed was cosy, clean and comfortable. Agri and Roger were accommodating and flexible with our requests which made everything very relaxed and comfortable for us. We would love to come back and stay with them again..."

36660,6752243,24-08-2013,6546138,Kelly & Adam,"My husband and I truly enjoyed our time in London and at the Blenhiem Lodge.  We felt very welcome by Roger and Agri and were given everything we needed to enjoy our stay.  It is a very short walk to the underground and about a 15-min trip to the sites downtown (16 pounds for two day passes on the underground).<br/><br/>We would recommend this place to others.  Enjoy your time!"
36660,6890502,29-08-2013,6374407,Françoise,Pour notre dernier soir à Blenheim Lodge nous avons pu dormir dans la chambre de nos rêves ouvrant sur le jardin. Décor cosy et confortable en toutes choses. Nous avons finalement passé 8 jours dans cette maison et c'est avec plaisir que nous avons pu faire connaissance avec Agri and Roger qui accueillent tous leurs hôtes avec gentillesse et convivialité. Une adresse à retenir et à recommander sans problème. Encore merci !!!!
36660,7091826,06-09-2013,3882156,Louis,"Nous avons apprécié au plus haut point notre séjour chez Agri et Roger. Le confort de notre chambre, véritable havre de paix avec sa porte qui donne sur le jardin était parfait. Les petits déjeuner sont complets avec un choix varié de pains, céréales, fromages, fruits, etc.<br/>Nous avons même eu droit à des fruits fraîchement cueillis de l'arbre par Roger. Très tranquille, sécuritaire et pratique. Nous recommandons fortement cet endroit."

Our room was wonderful and had a beautiful view of their well kept garden. Every morning we enjoyed a wide variety of continental breakfast items and fresh fruit. Agri and Roger were great host, being always available but never overbearing. They even helped us arrange our taxis and everything when we had to leave. Perfect homestay, I highly recommend them to anyone visiting London."
36660,7510024,23-09-2013,5507636,Diane,My stay with Roger and Agri was great. I had the downstairs bedroom which opens onto the beautiful back garden via French doors. The room was spacious and clean and the bathroom was right next door. Transport and shops are only a few minutes walk up the road as is the train into London. A lovely place to stay close to London but far enough away to be out of the hussle and bustle. Continental breakfast was comprehensive and had in a room overlooking the garden. Would definitely stay again if in London  
36660,7868011,07-10-2013,6138038,Lenita,"Agri & Roger are friendly & helpful hosts. We stayed in the garden room, which is lovely.

We zullen hen zeker aanbevelen aan vrienden die ook een bezoekje willen brengen aan Londen. De ligging (niet ver van een metrostation) was ideaal en toch rustig genoeg (kamer met zicht op de tuin) gezien het huis langs een vrij drukke weg gesitueerd is
36660,8016399,13-10-2013,3620695,Lori,"The room and house were just as in the pictures. A very comfortable stay after arriving jet lagged to London from Medford, Oregon. We took the tube from Heathrow and walked the two or three blocks to the lodge. Agri and Roger were friendly and helpful. The breakfast was served in a room facing the garden and was lovely. There was something for every appetite. There are restaurants and pubs nearby. A great place to relax."

The accommodation was a delight, particularly the breakfasts - some bnbs seem to have forgotten about the second b (for breakfast). The house is an easy 5 minute walk from East Finchley tube and on the main bus route.  Agri & Roger also provided a plethora of local knowledge.  Loved my stay (and their two cats)."

They were very helpful in the preparations for our stay with them and provided valuable information along the way. During our time with them, they were very clean and orderly, friendly, prompt, and went above and beyond for us in every way. Breakfasts were good, and the room was comfortable and clean. <br/>The location is great, the walk to the underground is not too far but not so close that you feel like you are living near a train station. We stayed for 11 nights and enjoyed every night there.<br/>There are a lot of options out there for BnB's and rooms in London, if you are feeling overwhelmed with where to go, I would suggest booking here, you will not be disappointed!

I can only say that we are really grateful to be welcomed there, and thank you Mr. and Mrs. Ford for endearing us and ensuring that you made us feel that “Mi casa es su casa”.

My son and I spent a wonderful week in London.<br/> We really enjoyed Agri's marvelous breakfast watching sqirrels, magpies and pigeons in the garden. Our room with garden view was light, clean and  comfortable with a bathroom just outside. Bam Bam the cat stayed with us purring and cuddling fluffily.<br/>I will certainly stay in Blenheim Lodge again and recommend it to my friends!"

36660,12940838,15-05-2014,7752,Randy,"This is my 4th stay with Agri and Roger at the Blenheim Lodge in East Finchley.  Each time has been most enjoyable.  Agri and Roger and two wonderful hosts who provide and experience to their guests.  They are wonderfully personable, you can have wonderful communications with others from all over the world at their breakfast table, and you get a fine bed to sleep on.  I have stayed in most every room at the Lodge and I will say I have no special one.  I highly recommend the Blenheim Lodge as a great place to stay.  There is no warmer AirBNB host than Agri and Rodger.  I a sure I will be seeing them again soon."

36660,13731147,03-06-2014,10555965,Eilat,"Agri and Roger are the SIMPLY THE BEST!!! They are a warm, lovely couple, who make you feel at home right away. They were very helpful with advise and information, as well as generous with their space- we were able to use the kitchen and the fridge. We stayed in two different rooms and loved them both, not to mention the garden and Bam Bam the cat. Breakfast was UNBELIEVABLE - there was something there for almost every taste! We could have spent the whole day at the dining room, just eating, chatting, and enjoying the view of the beautiful garden, created by Roger. The house is well-located, with easy access to the Underground. "
36660,14008470,10-06-2014,10661416,Birgit,"We were guests on the Blenheim Lodge for four nights. It was a lovely stay and we enjoyed so much.

36660,14151014,13-06-2014,14103367,Mike And Audra,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we were NOT disappointed. My husband and I stayed three nights in Agri & Roger's garden room that had a great view of their beautiful yard and birdfeeders. The underground station was a 5 minute walk away, it was a 15-20 minute ride into London on the Northern Line, and the local pub (The Olde White Lion) was perfect for evening meals (it is located between underground station and A&R's house). We would totally stay here again!"
36660,14384665,18-06-2014,11186365,Deanna,"Both Roger and Agri welcomed and helped me prior to arrival by providing all relevant information on how to get from airport to their home.  Upon arrival Agri showed me all one needed to know about the home, gave me tea and snacks, and became a friend.  Their home and garden are lovely.   You could not ask for a more tranquil environment.  They have been hosting for a long time and know how to do it with style and friendliness!  Transportation to Central London is easy.  I would return anytime and recommend them highly.   "

There is a tube station nearby, as well as a supermarket, pub, pharmacy, and variety of eateries. The Northern Line takes you straight into the city centre. A lovely place to stay!"
36660,16972318,05-08-2014,6642775,Zahava,"Agri and Roger are the ultimate hosts. Not only did they make me feel welcome but the room and the house was everything you would want in a bed and breakfast. The fact that the wonderful garden was accessible from my bedroom made the experience all the more special. Clean as clean can be. Location to East Finchley station is prime.  As the motto says: ""Guaranteed to love this"", and I did. Would not hesitate to stay here again when returning to London. Thanks!!"
36660,17426288,12-08-2014,4530487,Paola,"The house and the bedroom were exactly as those in the description, very lovely. Tha bathroom is provided with a nice shower with hot water, towels, soaps, shampoo and hairdrier.  The area is quiet but provided with everything you would need, shops, pub, supermarket, cinema.. The tube station is 5minute walk from the house.  When we arrived they weren't at home but there was a nice lady who welcomed us. Breakfast is superb with everything you can wish for.  They are also available to offer tips and advices for places worth visiting in the area. To sum up, we had a great stay. "

36660,18059770,21-08-2014,2820153,Terry,"""You're guaranteed to love this"" sounds like hyperbole, but was entirely true for us. Agri and Roger were welcoming and attentive without hovering, and the breakfast was lavish and varied. Our bedroom lived up to the lovely photos, and the back garden give an impression of being in the country rather than north central London. Our bed was deeply comfortable. It's as close as an affordable London b&b can come to the experience of being a guest at an English country manor. <br/>The tube station is near enough to be easy for folks with luggage to drag, and we recommend the Nahling Thai restaurant ten minutes walk from Blenheim house.<br/>Agri and Roger, thanks again!"

Roger emailed me back and forth in response to my many queries, and once we were there, both he and Agri were warm and helpful in every way. They even turned the heat up for us after discovering that we'd just left a chilly week on a canal boat! Highly recommended. Note: A lovely cat leaves a bit of hair about the house, so if you are allergic, be aware."
36660,18653412,30-08-2014,5607826,Marissa,"We had an excellent airbnb experience at the Blenheim Lodge! Agri and Roger were incredibly helpful and hospitable, and we had everything we needed for our stay, including reliable wifi.  It was a good sized room with a wonderful view of the garden, and the place was outside the touristy chaos of London so it felt very relaxing.  The breakfast was included which was a really nice amenity that helped us keep costs reasonable, and it was a great way to meet other people staying at the lodge. It was also very helpful to be so close to the metro stop to get right into the city. We felt very comfortable here and would definitely come back again when in London."

Agri was so helpful and made sure we had seen all the highlights of London before we left. The house is very old and beautiful, I had a very interesting conversation with Agri about it, how they aren't allowed to change things because it's a protected building. The breakfast was lovely, we had so much choice... and an amazing view towards the fantastic garden! Thank you so much, I'll definitely recommend this place!"
36660,19115450,07-09-2014,6548674,Vanessa,My husband and I came to London for the first time as part of our honeymoon trip. Agri and roger were amazing. They greeted us every morning. The breakfast had a wide variety every morning. Since it was our honeymoon Agri and roger surprised us with champagne! <br/>Our room had the view to the yard. It was nice and private and it is even nicer than the pictures. <br/>Our train to Europe only left in the afternoon and they told us we could stay in the room until it was time to leave as no one was checking into our room that day. <br/>I would recommend this place to anyone. Easy to get to your locations with the train just a few minutes away. They know London inside and out which helped with directions. Wish my stay was longer just so I could stay with them. <br/>Thank you. <br/>Ps I already miss their cats!

Roger offered us breakfast before we departed for the first day of seeing London.<br/><br/>One day we wandered past the East Finchley Tube station into town and stumbled across a really great coffee roaster. I regret not having more time in the area.<br/><br/>Our accommodations were nice- very quiet, easily accessible to Tube station just down the street.  We thoroughly enjoyed our short visit and can recommend Roger and Ari to prospective tenants!<br/><br/>Thanks for your hospitality!<br/><br/><br/>"

Our stayed came with garden view and I could usually see ""Pam-Pam"" the Miao doing his sunbathing at the garden table. East Frinchley is a posh area, we took the opportunity to take a bus ride to go around the area and I was impressed with the neighborhood on how their could preserved the 100 years building so well.  Variety of bfast available on the daily basis, the common bathroom is just next to our room and we have no issue of sharing with others, I would definitely staying there again if I return sometimes."

Sin excesos sino francos y permitiendo que uno se sintiera como en su casa pudiendo preparase un te o cafe o solicitando alguna orientacion o consejo sobre cualquier necesidad que se planteara.
36660,25653960,22-01-2015,33770,Jonathan,"We stayed 6 nights; 3 nights  in the family room with our 2 kids and 3 nights just the two of us in a regular room. Both rooms were great; very comfortable with a warm and very pleasant aesthetic. The location is excellent, very near shops and the tube, yet because the house is set back from the road it is also quiet. Agri was a wonderful host, very helpful and friendly. She also lays on a sumptuous breakfast that we greatly appreciated.  In short, I highly recommend this place."
36660,26412619,12-02-2015,9405425,Matthew,"Agri was a very warm hostess throughout our two week stay. As described in many other reviews, Blenheim Lodge is just a five minute walk from the East Finchley Tube station and a twenty minute ride to the West End, so it was a perfect base for us. Large continental breakfast, a very reasonable price, a cozy atmosphere - what's not to like. "
36660,26915783,22-02-2015,4857800,Kate,Could not ask for better hosts or place to stay. Thank you.
36660,27142045,26-02-2015,14116735,Wenqian,"Best ever! I will definitely come back and stay with Agri &Roger again. The flat just got everything you need. As it is described, you are guaranteed to love it. And now I'm 100% sure about it."
36660,28615506,27-03-2015,28767877,Karina,"Für uns war es die erste Reise nach London und die Unterkunft von Agri & Roger war ein wundervoller Ort dafür. Wir fühlten uns herzlich willkommen und konnten sie immer fragen wenn wir Informationen benötigten. Das Zimmer beinhaltet alles was man braucht und auch das Gemeinschaftsbad war sehr komfortabel. Der Garten hinter dem Haus ist eine kleine Oase. Das Haus ist nur wenige Minuten von der U-Bahn entfernt, mit der man in 20 Minuten das Stadtzentrum erreicht. Sehr empfehlenswert."
36660,28882280,31-03-2015,1107789,Quentin,"Hôte fabuleux et qui a de l'expérience !<br/>Agri et Roger nous mettent à l'aise. La chambre ressemble exactement à la photo, et la salle de bain et spacieuse et bien tenue.<br/>Sans parler du petit déjeuner complet et fait maison.<br/>Je recommande chaudement."
36660,29125395,04-04-2015,29368995,Jessie,"Great time with them, will def visit them other than stay in hotel in my next trip. Thank you "
36660,29402043,07-04-2015,27774487,Charlotte,"Séjour idéal dans la maison d'Agri et Roger, la maison est très belle, dans un quartier résidentiel du nord de Londres, à 5 min à pied du métro, et la chambre correspond parfaitement à la description! Accueil parfait, Agri et Roger sont des hôtes remarquables. Je les recommande évidemment sans hésitation! "
36660,29809409,13-04-2015,17187285,Heike,"Obwohl wir schon vormittags ankamen, konnten wir sofort einschecken. Sehr herzliche Begrüßung. Saubere, gemütliche Unterkunft, sehr familiär, da es immer Kontakt zu den Bewohnern des Hauses gab. Der Kater Bam Bam auch sehr verschmust, ""und immer hungrig :)"", erinnerte uns irgendwie an unsere Katzen. Reichhaltiges Frühstück, nach dem die Touren beginnen konnten, 3min. zur Underground, den Bussen. Wir können die Unterkunft nur empfehlen. Und da wir 5 Tage schönes Wetter hatten, konnten wir auch auf der Sonnenterrasse sitzen und u.a. Eichhörnchen beobachten."
36660,30186582,19-04-2015,14568752,Laure,"Agri et Roger sont des hôtes charmants qui mettent à disposition une jolie chambre confortable avec accès direct sur un joli jardin et une salle de bains spacieuse. La maison se trouve dans un quartier agréable et assez cossu, il faut environ 20 minutes de métro pour Leicester Square et 5 minutes à pied pour rejoindre la station de métro.<br/>"
36660,30719392,26-04-2015,31032165,Uranela,"Die Gastgeber waren freundlich und hilfsbereit; sie haben uns aufgrund unseres späten Fluges und der sehr späten Ankunft nachts  freundlich empfangen und auf unser Zimmer gebracht und kurz erläutert, wo sich das Bad befindet bzw. wann es Frühstück gibt. Das Frühstück war gut, vor allem jeden Tag der frische Obstsalat war toll und alles absolut vegetarisch! Das Zimmer ist sehr groß und geräumig und mit Blick auf den tollen sehr schönen Garten und die dazugehörige kleine Terrasse mit eigenem Sitzplatz. Leider ist das B&B nichts für Personen mit Allergie, da eine Katze im Haushalt lebt und in jedem Zimmer, selbst im Bad, Teppiche und mehrere Läufer aus liegen - schade! Auch muss man es mögen, dass man sich das Bad auf der Etage mit den anderen Gästen teilt. Alles in allem aber gut."
36660,31298210,04-05-2015,27671509,Lindsey,"Both of our hosts made us feel very welcome, the neighbourhood was as described and East Finchley has all the amenities you would expect for a small village. (Pharmacy, Groceries, post office, shops, and multiple places to eat). They are located very close to the underground and the garden level room was just as pictured. We had a lovely stay (despite my second day food poisoning -- from a restaurant). <br/><br/>They offered breakfast that was full of cereals, muffins, breads, cheese and fruit as well as a selection of tea and coffee. Our room was very quiet and the bed was very comfortable. The windows and door allowed us to temperature control our room and we slept very soundly. <br/><br/>We had a great time staying at this place and it was very beautiful and so convenient to get to central london. (The tube took about 20 minutes to get to Charing Cross or Bank. To get to Heathrow it was about an hour and a half.) <br/><br/>In another note, the host went out of their way to make sure that I was doing well (when I was extremely sick). They gave me bananas from their kitchen to help me get through that day and always helped to supply my room with a pitcher of water. It was a lifesaver. They were extremely accommodating and always were kind. "
36660,31638220,08-05-2015,15839043,Tom,"Agri and Roger were expecting us and welcoming.  The large garden is quite lovely and a surprise in London.  Blenheim Lodge was a fine old house, not in central London but close to the tube (zone 3) and bus.  We felt quite comfortable.  Everything we needed was there.  The neighborhood has nice restaurants and parks.  We enjoyed our stay.  Thank you."
36660,31870187,11-05-2015,18897685,Lisa,"We were made to feel so welcome by Roger and Agri and loved our stay at Blenheim Lodge. There wasn't anything they hadn't thought of including a fabulous breakfast with a huge choice of food items, water pitchers in our rooms, extremely comfortable bed with a view of an exquisite garden. They gave us privacy but were available to answer our questions. Both were very knowledgable about the area and there were maps and brochures of London in our room. Having the underground right down the street made for being in a great location. I would recommend Blenheim Lodge to anyone and we'll definitely book here next time we're in London. Definitely our favorite place we've stayed so far!"
36660,32489293,19-05-2015,19833077,Fay,"We stayed a week in May, 2015 and found Agri and Roger to be friendly hosts. It was a great location for us, close to the Underground and shopping. We had a beautiful view of the garden and the room was as described in the listing, However, we did not expect to share the bath with so many people in the household and had difficulty turning the shower on and off.  "
36660,33216063,26-05-2015,10780575,Celisse,"We had a wonderful time staying here. Agri was away while we stayed but her niece, Raquel, was there instead. Both Roger and Raquel were very friendly and welcoming. The room itself was quite comfortable and we didn't mind sharing the bathroom with other guests. The cold continental breakfasts were even better than we expected with croissants, scones, muffins, cheese, salami, yogurt, cereals, fruit, juice, coffee and tea. We also loved the location since it is a short ride on the tube away from the city center but provided a quiet place to spend our evenings and mornings."
36660,33527347,29-05-2015,32826786,Ariel,"Roger and Agri were absolutely wonderful hosts. They were very friendly and accommodating, and provided everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable. The room was cozy and inviting, and had many books, dvds, etc. on hand for use if wanted. The house and garden are beautiful and unique, and the breakfast provided was more than generous. The area is also very nice, and a 20 minute walk brings you to Kenwood house and park, which we found very very worth seeing. It is free, and contains a very nice, historical old mansion and a very magnificent art collection. The underground is also only a short walk away, which was extremely convenient. Overall, we had a wonderful stay, and would recommend Roger and Agri's hospitality to others."
36660,34408657,08-06-2015,28747041,Hong,EVERYTHING IS PERFECT.
36660,34790695,12-06-2015,30605338,Cathy,Merci Agri et Roger <br/>Nous avons passé un merveilleux moment dans votre maison.<br/>Nous avons apprécié la proximité des transports  surtout prendre la carte oyester qui permet  de circuler à volonté dans Londres  (métro et cars).
36660,34939776,14-06-2015,28747041,Hong,非常好的环境，正如描述那样：你一定会爱上这样的。在这里住了二周多，中间去剑桥牛津几日，再回来时，俨然回家一般。很怀念那段美好的时光，和主人相约，再携家人去“英国家“里住。  北三区的世外桃源，交通很方便，晚上看音乐剧、演出，11点多回来没有问题的。 地铁直达许多您想去的地方，主人好热情，早餐异常丰盛，很晚了回来，厨房里总是有热咖啡在壶里，家的感觉。
36660,35303135,17-06-2015,25629717,Elizabeth,"Agri and Roger are very welcoming. The setting was peaceful and comfortable. We really enjoyed the garden at the back of the house. The breakfast was just great with so many varieties. Location is very convenient, just a few minutes walk from the overground sation. Very good choice in terms of costs and what you can get in such a metropolitan city! Will recommend!"
36660,35451518,19-06-2015,12550995,Dominique,"Agri & Roger were so welcoming when we first arrived.  The room/flat are very quiet and peaceful and the room doors open to the garden which makes for a nice view and resting place.  The location is only a short walk to the underground station.  From the underground station, it's about a 25ish minute tube ride to central London.  The breakfast was nice and Agri & Roger are helpful with anything you may need!"
36660,35768500,22-06-2015,27412384,Beej,"Lovely location and hosts, my husband would have liked to stay there for a month! Very peaceful, we did not feel like we were in London at all. Thank you Agri and Roger"
36660,37446255,07-07-2015,9082065,Laura,My sister and her boyfriend stayed here and had a very good experience. They especially loved their room with doors opening into the garden. Agri and Roger were very welcoming and helpful.  The only thing is that the house is a bit further away from the main attractions.
36660,37739033,10-07-2015,18181649,Miriam,"Heerlijke plek om na een drukke stadsdag te verblijven. Mooi uitzicht op de tuin, rustige buurt en prima verbinding met metro of bus. Warme ontvangst en verzorging. Absoluut een aanrader!"
36660,39165351,21-07-2015,33373721,Edith,"Le logement était tel que décrit, une grande chambre avec une petite terrasse très agréable donnant sur un joli jardin. J'avais peur que l'on soit trop loin du centre de Londres mais on n'est qu'à 20 minutes. De plus, tout était dans la chambre : le serviettes, l'adaptateur, le sèche cheveux, et même les dictionnaires français anglais (très pratique quand on l'a oublié) "
36660,39436295,23-07-2015,6498236,Yu,Agri and Roger they are very welcoming and helpful to me. the location is quite close to the tub for five mins. i saw the lovely fox in the garden.

36660,42257124,12-08-2015,32126697,Sungmi,"Agri and Roger were one of the BEST people (not just hosts) I've ever met in my life. They were so considerate, warm-hearted that my mom and I could make good memories in London although my mom's mobile phone was stolen during our trip. Especially when we were confused at this bad situation, they gave us a warm cup of tea and sincere consolation that help us a lot. <br/><br/>Everything, including the room, bathroom, and GARDEN, was exactly the same as seen in these pics (or even better). I was happy to figure out their consideration for guests from every single detail such as slippers, a bottle of water. My mom loved freshly scented & cozy bedding, and greenish garden as well. For me, the breakfast served was my favorite. I'm pretty sure that you must be surprised at the table setting every morning. When it comes to the location, you can easily approach to tubes that will get you everywhere.<br/><br/>To be short, you are ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEED TO LOVE this house in London. You can have my words. Never miss the opportunity to stay at this beautiful house with beautiful hosts, or I will go myself during my next visit to London."
36660,42565532,14-08-2015,37904242,Jay,"This was such a lovely villa has an amazing garden. We loved it because we can feel like staying at home. Tube station is very close. Everything was as they mentioned on air bnb website. Thank you, Agri and Roger!"
36660,42874868,16-08-2015,37125157,Eng Wee,"Both Agri & Roger were such fantastic hosts. Upon confirming the booking, they will send you a message on directions in getting to their place and the directions were so precise that you definitely will not miss the house.  When we arrived at the house, Roger greeted us and showed us around the dining hall, kitchen, toilet and room.<br/>The house is as lovely as the pictures provided.  I love the spaciousness of the toilet and every part of the house including toilet and room is well decorated.<br/>The breakfast spread was fantastic.  <br/>On the last day when we checked out, my hubby left his spectacles in their house, Agri drove out to the train station immediately to pass it back to us.  Thank you for that.<br/>Though the location of the house is out from the central of london, I feel that the experience is worth it."
36660,43362500,19-08-2015,8857097,Melissa,"Agri and Roger were both great! Not only was the house itself very classic, friendly, and welcoming, Agri was great getting us settled, definitely felt comfortable right away.  Great homey feel, and Roger was also very friendly and made you feel happy to be there.  Was a great place to come home too after a busy day in the city - very convenient to the tube station, and Agri was happy to give directions and maps as needed to make sure we got everywhere we wanted to go.  Overall a great experience, and I would definitely recommend and stay again!"
36660,44120033,24-08-2015,2587682,Julie,This is a lovely room with a door out onto a patio.  One of the days I stayed was very hot (30 degrees celsius) and having access to the outdoors was handy for drying laundry.  The room is right next to the bathroom that has a shower (not over a bath) which has very good water pressure.  There is a big screen TV and the bed is comfortable.  The room is also next to the kitchen which is handy for making cups of tea.  I would recommend this room as it is spacious and very pretty.  The neighbourhood is good and the property is very close to the tube station which is about a 5 minute walk and it only takes 25 minutes get into Central London.

36660,45800978,06-09-2015,38950700,Miriam,Had a great time. Location very convenient to tube stop. Very nice breakfast and friendly and helpful hosts. Really enjoyed our stay. 
36660,47477524,19-09-2015,19384596,Li,房东是个特别和蔼的人，到了家门口他马上把我的行李推进去，特别的客气。我住的是单人间，房间特别的温馨，房间外面有好多的鲜花和树木空气很好。地理位置也很方便，去地铁口只用5分钟，是我住过最喜欢的家庭旅馆。
36660,48506938,27-09-2015,10876304,Kari,"Had the most delightful stay with Agri & Roger as well as with our co-guest from Hongkong, Germany & U.S. Our garden room and overall accommodation was excellent & the proximity of Blenheim House to London was so easy. The beautiful Kenwood House on the boundary of nearby Hampstead Heath was a wonderful surprise bonus. Would have no hesitation to stay again."
36660,48862071,29-09-2015,28477227,Dmitriy & Marina,"We had the option of parking our car in front of the house, which was nice. We stayed 2 nights. It was warm and cozy in the room and house all the time. They provided a clean cot for our baby and toys as well. Our friends were staying at the same place and we enjoyed seeing them for breakfast."

36660,50171505,10-10-2015,40167612,Jessica,"Agri & Roger were very kind and welcoming. Blenheim Lodge is close to public transport--it takes about 20 minutes via the tube (Northern Line) to central London, which was easy and convenient. The room was spacious, quiet and comfortable and just like the photos. The continental breakfast was delicious with so many choices. My sister and I would definitely stay there again due to the price, location and lovely accommodation space."
36660,50656082,13-10-2015,25345268,Susan,It is a wonderful place for us to stay in London! The room is so comfortable and the garden is fantastic ! We love so much and hope to be there in next trip!

36660,51696873,24-10-2015,28135494,Kristi,"Agri and Roger were very friendly and hospitable. They were very good at letting us come and go without feeling like we had to have a conversation with them every time we saw them, which is probably a bit difficult to do when people are staying in your home. We loved the spaciousness of our room and the view to the beautiful back yard! We appreciated the empty armoire to put our clothes in, the chairs to sit in, and being next to the bathroom. We would recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind staying a bit of a distance from central London and want to get experience staying in a British home. We loved having real coffee for breakfast each morning! Our last night there we discovered a cafe about a half block from the tube station in East Finchely called The New Local Cafe. The prices were very good compared to all the places we'd been, the portions were sizable and delicious, and the staff was very friendly. "
36660,52254723,27-10-2015,45588626,Jose,"Dans cette maison typiquement anglaise Agri and Roger nous ont accueilli chaleureusement.<br/>La localisation de la maison est parfaite, c'est un endroit idéal pour profiter au maximum de Londres tout en étant très proche du métro dans un quartier calme et agréable.<br/>La chambre est confortable et le petit déjeuner très copieux.<br/>De bon matin on peut admirer la vue sur le jardin fleuri et voir des écureuils!!!<br/>J'ai apprécié pouvoir parler en espagnol a Agri lorsque je ne trouvais pas mes mots en anglais...<br/>Toujours disponible et soucieux du bien-être de ses invités ils nous ont offert un week-end merveilleux!<br/>Si je retourne à Londres ce sera chez Agri and Roger!!!"
36660,53529174,09-11-2015,41193841,Evie,"We loved our stay with Agri and Roger, we couldn’t have been made more welcome.

The neighbourhood was quiet and in walking distance from shops, restaurants and the tube into the city centre. "
36660,53936240,14-11-2015,44623224,Keith,"This was my first airbnb experience and Agri & Roger were a lovely host. We chatted for a while about our travelling experiences. <br/>The place was well placed for me as I used to live in the area and it had great car parking and easy access to the north circular. And not far from east finchley tube.<br/>The room was roomy and comfortable. "

36660,58273775,02-01-2016,13408955,Larissa,Alles war genauso wir im Inserat beschrieben. Das Frühstück war super und bestand nicht nur aus Müsli. Wir waren bereits das zweite Mal bei Agri und Roger und wir sind noch immer genauso begeistert wie vor einem Jahr. Die Beiden sind total hilfsbereit und versuchen einem bei Fragen so weit es geht zu helfen. Das Zimmer war sehr schön und sauber. Die Unterkunft bei Agri und Roger ist einfach nur zu empfehlen.
36660,60273917,21-01-2016,261956,LIz,"We had an amazing time at Roger and Argris home. We enjoyed the proximity to public transport, the high road shops and the number of tourist destinations we could visit just 30 minutes away from their home. Breakfast is incredible, comfortable beds, lovely garden! A definite place to stay when in London. "
36660,62640563,15-02-2016,43242490,Jinan,We love the house very much and spent nice time with the lady. We felt very warm and cozy there just like our home.

It's everything they describe and more as they did everything possible to make sure I was comfortable.  Both rooms I stayed in were great, but the downstairs room off the garden is a jewel.  The rooms are bright and flowers are the theme.  A lovely breakfast with many choices waiting every morning. Easy to take the Northern line to King's Cross and from there easily access anyplace in London or by train to other places in the UK.  This would be my first choice for my next visit to London.<br/><br/>"

36660,70449896,17-04-2016,38256712,Paul,"We felt welcome from the beginning. The room was cosy, separate part of the house so felt private enough. The tube - underground was nearby, nice pub. Unfortunately rainy so we could not sit in the beautiful garden. The breakfast was great, even as good as in a hotel. Big plus!<br/>So summarized: next visit is in our thoughts."

Agri habla español y eso facilita las cosas cuando no te sientes muy seguro con el inglés. La habitación es igualita que en la foto, las vistas al jardín son espectaculares tanto desde la habitación como desde la sala de desayunos. Además de las vistas y la puerta al jardín, la habitación es muy amplia y tiene televisión, toallas, secador, una jarra de agua con vasos y muchos libros y guías para leer. La casa está muy bien acondicionada, limpia y es muy bonita. Los desayunos son completísimos, muy abundantes y variados, no les falta ni un detalle. El barrio donde se encuentra la casa es tranquilo, bien cuidado y muy agradable.    <br/><br/>Sin duda volveríamos a alojarnos aquí en otra visita a Londres y la recomendaremos a todos nuestros amigos y familiares."

36660,73327317,08-05-2016,29215485,Peter,"Agri&Roger sind wunderbare Gastgeber. Die Zimmer waren sogar noch schöner als ohnehin schon auf dem Portal beschrieben. Sie kümmern sich wirklich um ihre Gäste. In diesem Fall besonders wichtig, da unsere Töchter im Reisezeitraum noch keine 18 waren. Sie haben sich per Mail gemeldet, waren auch für uns Eltern jederzeit ansprechbar, haben die Mädchen liebevoll umsorgt und mit wunderbaren Tipps ausgestattet. Eine sehr gute Wahl und unbedingt empfehlenswert."
36660,74888910,17-05-2016,19364676,Tina,Our 2nd stay with Agri & Roger was just as delightful as the first. Very lovely people to be around. Go out of their way to help you. Would love to visit again one day.
36660,76075555,24-05-2016,50345117,Nicole,"Agri hat uns mit einem sehr guten Kaffee und einer gemütlichen Unterhaltung begrüßt und Heiner erst einmal mit einem Toast mit Erdnussbutter und Honig notversorgt. Die familiäre, aber unaufdringliche Atmosphäre war sehr angenehm und die Unterhaltungen interessant und offenherzig. Wir durften sogar die wunderschönen, leckeren, von der Nichte selbstgemachten Empanadas versuchen. Das alleinstehende, sehenswerte Backsteinhaus aus dem 19. Jahrhundert ist ideal gelegen: in Gehweite von Hampstead Heath, ein paar Schritte zur Northern Line und somit mit sehr guter Anbindung in die City oder sonst wo hin. <br/>Der gepflegte Garten mit den wuseligen Eichhörnchen, Ringeltauben und Elstern macht morgens beim entspannten Frühstück im Wintergarten sehr viel Freude. Wir hatten das Glück auch von unserem Zimmer den Blick auf den Garten zu haben.<br/>Das Zimmer ist gut ausgestattet, gemütlich und sauber. Das Bad hat auch alles, was man braucht, selbst wenn man keine Pflegemittel dabei haben sollte.<br/>Die neuen doppelverglasten Fenster, die wir am letzten Abend noch in unserem Zimmer erleben durften, sind sicherlich eine Verbesserung, weil sie Heizenergie sparen werden. Wir haben in Agris und Rogers Haus eine perfekte Woche in London verbracht. <br/>Agri hat uns netterweise bei unserer Abreise morgens mit unseren inzwischen schwerer gewordenen Koffern noch zur Bahn gefahren und uns so einen etwas beschwerlichen Weg erspart.<br/>Insgesamt war alles super!"
36660,76521309,27-05-2016,19642342,Mina,"My stay in London with Agri & Roger was as pleasant as I expected it having had in mind their description of the room and service they provide. The place is easy to reach, close to the underground station and the very center of London; the room is clean and pleasant; the bed is comfortable; the hosts - relaxed, friendly and ready to help even beyond one’s reasonable expectations."
36660,77924656,04-06-2016,58322534,Martha,"Agri and Roger were wonderful hosts. They were welcoming and very helpful answering our many questions. Our room was comfortable with an amazing view of the beautifully landscaped back yard. East Finchley tube stop was a 5 minute walk which made it convenient to getting in and out of London. We were a bit surprised at how crowded the subway was most of the times we travelled at various times of the day. Once we got the hang of the system, we managed to get around the most congested areas of London. The local pub, The White Lion, was adjacent to the tube and was a welcoming watering hole at the end of our busy days for good food and drink. Using Airbnb is new to us, but a very positive experience due to our helpful, kind hosts. Breakfast was filling with great Columbian coffee. Our only new experience was sharing a bathroom with another couple, but we were told in advance this would happen. It just takes getting used to and everyone tried to be considerate of its use. The amount we saved in accommodations with Agri and Roger far out weighted any inconvenience. We would rebook with no question on future trips to London with Agri and Roger."
36660,79155684,11-06-2016,66149108,Jasmim,This is my first time using Airbnb and Adri&Roger gave me a wonderful experience. This stay in East Finchley will be an unforgettable memory in London.
36660,79644338,13-06-2016,65742783,Rachael,"Agri & Roger were great. They were very welcoming and friendly throughout our entire stay. The house was cosy and clean, and the room lived up to the pictures. It offered a lot of space and access to a beautiful garden. Agri & Roger provided a variety of pastries, cereal, toast, fruit, coffee, and tea for breakfast in a pretty dining room with a great view of the garden. The house was quiet and sharing the bathroom with guests in another room was easy. The bathroom was large, clean, and easily accessible to both rooms. Check out was at 10am, but our flight was not until 9:30pm. Another guest was arriving to take over our room in the afternoon, but Agri & Roger generously offered to hold onto our luggage so we could take advantage of our final day. The neighborhood was beautiful, we wished we would have had more time to explore it. The West Finchley tube station was only a short walk down the street, so we were able to get to wherever we wanted to go easily. I would definitely recommend this room to anyone looking for a quiet and comfortable place to stay with easy access to transportation."
36660,80090862,16-06-2016,70828913,Felix,"It was an amazing place, very beautiful, quiet and a short walk to the tube to get to the city center. Agri and roger were very friendly and helpful and it was a pleasure to stay with them. Overall I can only recommend the Blenheim lodge! "
36660,80310171,17-06-2016,75986143,Eliane,"<br/>Die Unterkunft bei Agri und Roger war sehr schön, der Garten paradiesisch. Die Gastgeber waren sehr freundlich und das Morgenbuffet ausgezeichnet und reichhaltig. Ich habe mich bei ihnen sehr wohl gefühlt und würde diese Unterkunft jederzeit weiterempfehlen. <br/>"
36660,81899086,25-06-2016,34785102,Peter,"Agri and Roger were excellent hosts and nade us very welcome.   The location was close to East Finchley Tube station and our room was on the ground floor, very good for us as we had a lot of luggage.    "
36660,85638357,12-07-2016,45193921,Rachel,"We were very happy with our stay at Agri and Roger's house. The room was cozy and clean with a beautiful view of the garden. They served a continental breakfast each morning and went over and above helping us with directions or calling a car service.  The neighborhood was really friendly, with a lot of great restaurants and grocery stores. We were even able to do laundry! Everything was a short walk from the house which was really convenient.  Be mindful that with this room you do share a bathroom with other guests but that was not a problem for us. "
36660,86545249,16-07-2016,50687738,Sharon,We loved our trip to London and found Roger and Agri to be great hosts! Their lovely English home was a great reprieve from the days of sight seeing in busy London. It was easily accessible from the nearby tube station and a great location in London's north end. We would definitely recommend it.
36660,87278082,19-07-2016,1501679,Jonathan,"A truly lovely place with a clean, bright room, comfortable bed and wonderful view of the garden - in a great location.  Agri and Roger were excellent hosts as well, hospitable and kind, yet unintrusive.  The only downside was having to share a bathroom with other guests.  If the rooms had en-suite facilities, this place would be 5 Star."
36660,88748382,25-07-2016,2977373,Ruth,"Great experience in every way!  Lovely place, perfect location, great hosts.  Couldn't ask for a better home away from home!"
36660,91289048,04-08-2016,64342800,Patricia,"Blenheim Lodge is a nice place to rest while visiting London. Although located in the North, it is beside the Northern Line, from which you can barely go anywhere. We arrived by car and parked in the house, and from that moment on we moved around using the tube.<br/>Inside is a typical English house, warm and inviting (loved the fact that it is all layered with carpets), and Agri and Roger were very kind, especially to our 3-year-old child, who could move around and have fun with the variety of toys they have (in and out in the garden).<br/>The room is big, bright and with direct communication with the garden, wouldn't choose another one. It is just beside the bathroom. And although the kitchen is next to it we did not hear noises while being there.<br/>Buffet breakfast is varied and generous, served between 7.30 and 9.30."
36660,91692309,06-08-2016,45854994,Xiaochen,"We really enjoyed this experience! Everything is wonderful, the transportation is convenient and the hosts are really friendly and great, the room is clean and beautiful, if I go to London next time, I would still choose this accommodation again!!! Thanks a lot for helping us. See you!"
36660,92743382,09-08-2016,64647746,Phil,"We highly recommend this lovely room and welcoming hosts if you are ever visiting London for a few days. Agri and Roger made us feel very welcome from the minute we arrived. The room is large, light and airy and opens directly onto a little patio in the private enclosed garden, where you can sit and read or enjoy a coffee. Our hosts provided us with an amazing  breakfast spread every morning, it was so nice - Thank you very much Agri and Roger :-) . "

36660,104276115,25-09-2016,67154650,Bernadette,"This is the second time we've stayed with Roger and Agri and would recommend their place highly.  We stayed in the downstairs garden room this time and loved it.  We had access straight out onto a little patio and the garden beyond.  It was a quiet and private spot.  Roger and Agri are so very friendly, helpful and thoughtful.  When they found out we were celebrating an anniversary, they bought us a bottle of champagne to celebrate.  The location is terrific, so close to the tube station and bus stops.  It's a safe, friendly neighbourhood with a few good cafes and restaurants nearby."
36660,104777064,28-09-2016,23025991,Xiaoyu,"Great great experience at This place! About the location, it seems out of zone 2 but it's really convenient and the underground connect to everywhere in London and most places could be reached in 30 mins.<br/>About the room, very clean and cozy and the breakfast room is just faced the beautiful garden, everything is perfect. Agri&Roger is really nice, friendly and welcoming. highly recommend!"

We all liked to talk with them very much!<br/>The flat was brilliant. Bright windows, clean room, warm bed, good viewing, easy traffic, and HUGE backyard. Beautiful backyard  full of blooming flowers and green soft grass and all kinds of creatures.  Cats, squires, and FOX! Yes fox!! It is so lovely! "

36660,107936696,13-10-2016,5916830,Dale,Agri & Roger were most pleasant hosts and were very helpful in giving advice as to how to get about the area. A very relaxed stay with a lovely garden aspect.

36660,110447813,26-10-2016,34246695,Ying,"This is a wonderful experience living in Agri&Roger's house. The hosts are really kind and friendly. Everything in the house is as described and even better than which given by the introduction. The suddenly showing up of squirrels in the garden always gave us a surprise in the morning, and made the beginning of our traveling time full of delight and vatality. Besides,the breakfast is obviously England style and definitely yummy. We really enjoy our trip here. If we travel to London again, we will book this room without any hesitation. Thanks a lot."
36660,110767871,28-10-2016,41744125,Celia,"We were greeted by Agri & her sister, shown our beautiful room<br/>& offered a very welcomed cup of tea.<br/>Sitting over looking the glorious garden we were soon chatting about places, families & friends.<br/>Agri & Roger are excellent hosts & their house is wonderful.<br/>Our room was light, spacious & warm with the bathroom next door <br/>with lots of towels & lovely shower.<br/>Impressive  breakfast looking out over the garden, & if staying longer<br/>we would have sat outside on the terrace.<br/>Only 3 minutes walk from the Tube line where there are many bars & cafes we couldn't have chosen a better location.<br/>Ample private parking, we were able to leave our car unused, safe & secure during our stay.<br/>Thank you Agri & Roger.<br/>We will recommend you as hosts to our friends.<br/><br/>"
36660,111995252,03-11-2016,82187542,Lawrence,"It has been a long time since I've stayed at a B&B and so I was apprehensive about my stay at Blenheim Lodge but I needn't have been.<br/>The house is located a 5 minute walk from the East Finchley tube station on the main road. I had occasion on one night to return at 2:00 am and the neighbourhood seemed safe with lots of night buses running. It is about a 15 minute tube ride to central London. <br/><br/>On the day of my arrival I was greeted very warmly by Agri who happened to be baking a delicious Paraguayan dish that she invited me to sample along with a cup of tea both of which I enjoyed in my room. My room was exactly as described. The large windows that look out over the extensive gardens make the room even more spacious than it already is. The room was toasty warm and the bed very comfortable. The bathroom is located just outside the room and is shared with one other guest. In my case I never saw that guest and never had to wait for the bathroom. Everything in the bathroom functioned perfectly. As other reviewers have noted, the continental breakfast that is served between 7:30 and 9:30 is extremely generous. <br/><br/>It bears noting that this is Agri and Roger's home and therefore you cannot expect the total anonymity of a hotel or total separation from the lives of the hosts. I thought that I would miss that anonymity but in the end I appreciated the warm hospitality of my hosts and the glimpse into their very interesting lives. My privacy was respected at all times and at no time did I feel like an 'intruder'.  <br/><br/>On the evening before my departure I informed Agri that I would be leaving before the usual breakfast time of 7:30 and would just make myself a cup of tea. When I went to the breakfast room at 6:45 to make that tea, I found the usual generous breakfast laid out for me. That was typical of the kindness and hospitality extended to me by Agri and Roger during my stay at Blenheim Lodge. Thank you sincerely, Agri and Roger. I look forward to staying with you again on my next visit to London.    "

36660,115588931,25-11-2016,2587682,Julie,This room is lovely.  It has a door out onto a patio which in summer time would be nice to open up and there is a table to sit at and look out over a beautiful garden.  The room is very warm in winter and has a very comfortable bed.  There is easy access to the bathroom directly next to the room.  The house is quiet at night as is the neighbourhood.  The tube station is just a 5 minute walk and there are plenty of shops and places to eat in the high street.  A plentiful breakfast is provided and both Agri and Roger are exceptionally lovely hosts.  I have stayed with them a few times and highly recommend this room and their company.

Lieve en heel gastvrije mensen, een schitterend huis, een heerlijk ontbijt en een heel fijne omgeving om te zijn. Vijf minuten lopen vanaf de ondergrondse, en een kleine tien minuten van Finchley High Road, met winkels en restaurantjes. De binnenstad van London bereik je binnen 20 minuten, en na een dag in de stad is het heerlijk thuiskomen in Blenheim Lodge.

36660,155040847,27-05-2017,20343081,Wendy,"Roger & Agri were very good hosts exchanging pleasantries at breakfast , happy to help with information when asked. Sent good information through prior to our stay. <br/>We chose this property after reading previous reviews however we did't  'love it' if anything it over promised and under delivered. Probably OK for one night but I wouldn't recommend it for an extended stay. There were a number of things such as the pillows were like sleeping on sandbags, towels which didn't dry you after you had showered. Tea bags which were either very cheap and or old as the tea we made was grey and undrinkable. Bathroom was shared by quite a few and the hanging baskets in the shower were filled with heaps of what looked like partly used shampoo,conditioners etc. every time I used the bathroom I thought I was back flatting.<br/>Would we stay here again probably not."

36660,166308962,03-07-2017,78488323,Margaret,A fabulous place to stay when exploring what London has to offer. It's about a 20 min Tube ride from Central London and just far away enough to feel like you have a break from the city bustle. Agri and Roger are a delight and provide you with everything you'd need (breakfast!!! It was awesome!!). Plus the lodge is absolutely gorgeous and we loved hanging out in the garden!! I highly highly recommend!!
36660,169585350,13-07-2017,95828014,艳丽,我只想说，我们何其幸运选择了这家可爱的民宿。房东先生和太太是上天派来帮助我们的天使吧。我们很不幸在伦敦丢失了钱包，包括护照，信用卡，现金。我们一无所有，寸步难行。房东就象亲人一样帮助我们，帮我们出主意，查信息，开车带我去邮局取汇款，出门时帮我带好点心，晚上多晚回去总会发现已经给我做好了晚餐。更不可思议的是，他们居然无条件相信我，连续借给我钱。我是何其幸运，能碰到他们。我爱他们，不忍离开他们。临别时热烈拥抱，期待重逢。至于其他的硬件，那个巨大的美丽无比的后花园简直让人迷醉。房间虽然不大，条件不是最好的，但那又有什么关系呢？何况地理位置简直无敌。一切都是那么完美，谢谢！

36660,261939366,07-05-2018,177003152,Karen Kjær,"Blendheim Lodge er indbegrebet engelsk romantik. Værelset er hyggeligt med udgang til en dejlig lukket have med masser af blomster, fugle og egern. Sengen har en god 3/4 madras, så den er lidt smal til 2 pers. Morgenmaden er lidt kedelig, men opvejes af den skønne udsigt i udestuen til haven. På vej til undergrundsbanen East Finchley ca. 10 - 15 min. gang, ligger The Old White Lion, en fin gammel pub/restaurant med dejlig gårdhave.  Værterne er søde og rare hjælpsomme mennesker."

The house is clean, the bed is very comfortable, and the hosts are incredibly kind and welcoming. They made sure my daughter and I were comfortable, and went out of their way to help us throughout our stay, starting with accommodating us as we arrived much earlier than originally expected. Guests get well-balanced privacy and hosts’ support, plus a plentiful breakfast served in a sunroom surrounded by the garden! We also loved how close it was to the Tube station, and it only takes about 15 minutes by train to get to the centre. Thank you so much, Agri and Roger for your hospitality and kindness and for letting us share the tranquility of your house after each hectic day out in the city! We hope to come back."

36660,308394892,16-08-2018,74089199,Alice,我们就是被美丽大花园诱惑而去。没有失望，面向花园的房间很大，装饰有格调。居住很舒服。我们连住了三晚，很享受。我们还加了一晚他家的另一个房间，体验一般。小且透气不好。也看不到花园。所以我们还是推荐面向花园的这一间。
36660,325675743,20-09-2018,12100428,미나,5주동안 함께한 집인데 정이 들어 나올때 눈물이 날 정도로 좋았습니다^^ Agri와 Roger는 엄청 친절하고 상냥합니다^^ 집도 깨끗하고  필요한것을 말하면 즉시 응답해주셔습니다. 매일 안부를 물어봐주시고 좋은 곳도 추천해주시고 투어있는 날은 아침일찍 아침식사를 먹을 수 있도록 배려해 주셨습니다.  아침식사 대박입니다^^ 과일을 언제든지 먹게 해주시고 주방에서 simple food는 가능하게 해주셔서 우린 매일 한식을 먹었습니다~ 시내와는 거리가 있지만 지하철역과 집이 가까워 괜찮았습니다^^ 3존이라서 왠지 시내 구경하고 우리집에 가는 느낌이었습니다.  넓은 정원과 오래된 멋진 집 아이들은 계속 있고 싶다고 다음에 런던오면 꼭 이곳으로 오자고 하네요^^ 강추강추 또 강추입니다^^

It seems they get a steady stream of people who return to stay with them over the years.  <br/>Their home is lovely - especially the garden  which was beautiful despite it being the end of September.  We saw birds, foxes ( one was named Bushy) and a cat.  The location was ideal to visit London.  The Tube stop was a short walk away and really convenient to get anywhere in London.   Agri’s coffee was heavenly every morning!  <br/>Highly recommend their home.  Thank you."

The host gave easy detailed directions on how to get to the location from the airport and that is always a relief on a long day of traveling. <br/>Upon arrival walked us through, offered tea, and breakfast each morning. Beautiful yard. <br/>Nice spot to be a bit out of central London with an easy train ride in to all the major sites. <br/>Nearby the home (about 15-20 minute walk) is an excellent fish n chips place called Toff’s, highly rated on TripAdvisor and at a great cost. Unique cinema (Everyman Cinema) right in East Finchley town center for movies, highly recommend both of these!! <br/>Excellent stay for a true feel of England, thank you!"

Unless you want to go out at night, Agri and Roger's place is easily accessible (you can explore the whole city with the Northern line!). <br/>Most of all, you'll feel immediately at home there. I enjoyed really confortable nights in that room - it is really intimate and cosy - and nice mornings watching the squirrels flirt with the birds. A perfect Airbnb experience!"

Feels like home, is wonderfully comfortable and clean and offers fantastic breakfast. Agri went out of her way to accommodate all our needs and help us in every way possible. She welcomed us with tea and cake on our arrival on a rainy night and prepared us breakfast at 6 am when we needed to catch an early flight home when we were checking out. We will definitely be back! Highly recommended!"

36660,422537619,11-03-2019,154485121,Frances,"This was hands down the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in. The room was cute and the garden was stunning. Did I mention that one wall of the room was windows overlooking the lush garden? So beautiful! Plus, this Airbnb was just a quick walk from the tube station which was so convenient. On top of all that, Agri and Roger provided breakfast (in their sunroom overlooking the garden). This stay was more of five star bed and breakfast than just your normal Airbnb. If Agri and Roger’s house is available, I’ll gladly stay with them whenever Im in London."

Very friendly and accommodating to pre visit questions and extremely helpful upon arrival to help us feel welcome.  Location was ideal for us to easily use the tube.  View of gardens from room and breakfast area is exactly as promised - very nice! Excellent shower/bath, which is shared w hosts and other guests, but access was not a concern, as we were early to rise.<br/>Freshness of the breakfast options would be our only feedback. Fruit often appeared to be dated, as we're some of the bfast pasteries on certain days."

First thing, it is really close to the train station(about 6mins walk), easy access to the central London. Secondly, they prepared plenty of drinks and snacks for us even thought there was only 2 of us. By the way the breakfast is amazing! Thirdly, the bed is super soft! There is plenty of pillows of different softness and a really big and warm blanket. The style of the room is really good! Facing to the big garden. Agri and Rhee was also really nice!! We really enjoyed the stay !"
36660,435110296,09-04-2019,35231221,William,Roger and Agri are super sweet and welcoming.  Their home is only one block walk to/from the East Finchely Undergrown Station.  Grocery stores and Great Restaurants you can easily walk to.  Loved our garden view and hardy Continental Breakfast!  We can easily see why they have so many repeat customers.  We hope to stay with them again in the future!

The continental breakfast is excellent, with cereal, fruit, bread, juice, coffee and other selections available. Everything was as described. Agri & Roger are such welcoming hosts and more than happy to offer tips about where to go. I highly recommend this accommodation!"

36660,448627096,05-05-2019,101557636,Lorien,"We had a lovely stay. Beautiful garden views from both our bedroom and the breakfast room, sweet and cozy space, and so conveniently located to the tube. We wanted access to London while still being able to get away from the hustle- bustle at night, and this is exactly what we got at Blenheim Lodge. The White Lion pub is also a short walk down the road and we found it a stylish yet relaxed option for dinners out when we didn’t feel like going far. Finally, Agri and Roger are the loveliest people—so kind and accommodating. It’s really got a true BnB feeling as you’ll  have a chance to mingle with the hosts and one or two the guests at breakfast if you eat in the dining room, which overlooks their beautiful garden."

36660,476398547,26-06-2019,37412163,Jessica,"Agri and Roger's place was great for our needs. Agri met us outside her home the day of arrival and gave us a tour.  Their place is really simple to get to from the station. Their directions for how to get to is very concise and we appreciated it. Arriving and leaving was easy to do. Room is nice. A little different from how i imagined from pictures (seemed tinier) and there are apparently long time renters in above floor in the house,  but we never saw them. Breakfast was good. She took some time to chat,  which was nice.  Would recommend."

Agri is very enthusiastic. If my English is better, I may communicate with her more.

La habitación es cómoda, da al jardín, el cual es grande,  muy bonito y está bien cuidado; no hay ruido, se duerme muy a gusto y no hay límite de horario para entrar y salir.  Agri nos ofreció un variado desayuno todos los días, al estilo inglés, a nuestro antojo. East Finchley está alejado del centro, pero el metro se encuentra a dos calles de la casa y es muy eficiente. El buen trato de Agri y Roger dan un plus a este lugar."

It was really comfortable (and convenient) to wake up and have scrumptious breakfast in the scenic dining room every morning. I really enjoyed chatting with Roger and Agri who were both always available to address any questions or concerns. If you are traveling alone in London, I highly recommend their place as a source of support and an anchor during your trip!"

I stayed there for 10 days and it was the best staying ever. And they treat all the guests like grandparents. <br/>한국분들을 위한 후기 <br/>여성분들도 안심하고 묵을 수 있는 곳이며 <br/>저처럼 방에서 일을 해야하는 분들은 방 크기, 인터넷(줌 연결) 중요하실텐데 그 부분 괜찮습니다. 제일 좋은건 1층방이라 앞마당으로 연결되는 문이 방 안에 있다는 점! 저는 너무 추울 때 가서 아쉽네요. 시티센터 이동하시려면 지하철로 이삼십분은 가셔야합니다. 가격 생각하면 조금 먼 대신 더 넓은 방에서 여유롭게 지내실 수 있습니다. 조식포함도 장점이구요. 프라이버시 잘 보장되는 점도 좋아요. 주인분들이 절대 사생활 터치 안합니다. 그래도 말 많이 걸어주시고 엄청 친절한 편. 무조건 하루종일 나가서 관광 하실분들은 센터로 잡으시고 영국 재방문이시거나 나름 여유있게 다니실 분들, 일하셔야하는 분들은 괜찮으실겁니다. 아, 빨래는 불가하니 근처에 있는 (걸어서 10분거리) 코인 빨래방 가셔야 하는데 저는 현금이 없었어서 아저씨한테 대신 맡기는걸로(그냥 똑같이 세탁하는건데 남이 해주는거) 15-20파운드 냈어요 ㅠ 꼭 현금 챙겨가시구요~"

The house is as welcoming as the correspondence from them and comfortably slept 8 adults with room to spare. The short walk to the local tube station coupled with our week long Oyster passes made getting around the city and it’s surrounds easy, including to and from Heathrow. We knew we had been there just long enough when the owner of the local grocery recognized us from our daily shopping to supply our home cooked breakfasts that fueled our adventures in London. The row house is on a lovely residential street and is appointed with items that tell much about Elisa and Dom. We felt comfortable and safe in this west end neighborhood and highly recommend this Airbnb."
38610,98049827,29-08-2016,27005861,Daae,"My family and I had a great time at Elisa and Dom's house. We really enjoyed all the artistic decorations and the huge dining table, it was a great place to get all together. It was clean and cosy, and they provided us useful information and made us feel comfortable during our staying.<br/>It is a good location to stay quiet as well as travel to central London. A bit far to get to tube station but enjoyable walk with a local market, cafes and atmosphere.<br/>I would love to recommend people who are going to visit London with big family and want to feel true Londoners' life."

38610,155929715,29-05-2017,109371202,JoAnna,"I would highly recommend staying here! Everything is as pictured, and Elisa and Dom are very easy to work with. This was our first AirBnb experience and it did not disappoint. We will definitely be doing something like this again. Thank you Elisa and Dom!"
38610,159177485,10-06-2017,105196973,Susanne,"Thanks Dom and Elisa, we had a wonderfull Time in London. The accomodation was very comfortable, well equiped, we Realy fehlt like Home immediately! We loved the big kitchen with the range oven and especially the Little patio to sit outside. All of the rooms were cosy, beds comfortable. The neighborhood ist lively and multicultural. We liked that. Shopping and Rating out was nice and easy, Even with the Kids. That was thanks to your great House-manual which is realy Perfect to have!<br/>One hint: best longterm parking-posibility (of it is no Weekend and parking in jj is free) is in the westfield Shoppingcenter: 8£ for 24h Prozent, with a Short onlineregistration only 6£ for 24h. Maybe you want to add that to your manual.<br/>Thanks again for offering your home, so we couldhave made it ""ours"" for one week. We will always remember that!<br/>"

38610,182189764,14-08-2017,100641599,Henry,"A great house in a good location which we can recommend to anyone who wants to stay within easy reach of central London. For a couple of nights we had 10 sleeping there though the beds are double beds so if 10 people, need either to be friendly or someone needs to sleep on the sofa. Lots of interesting artwork."
38610,187180120,26-08-2017,2661690,Bridget,"We greatly enjoyed the house, the location, and the neighborhood.  Our surroundings certainly enhanced our family vacation: the grocers, the pubs, the soccer, QPR, yay, walkability, and access to the tube.  The ability to have all nine of us in one space enriched our family time together.  It was so nice to join others at the kitchen table for coffee, for a meal, or to catch up at the end of the day.  Not something that happens at a hotel…<br/>Excellent communication response/information with/from Elisa and Dom"
38610,203104594,14-10-2017,72941571,Kim,"We loved the location. The house was warm, comfortable and convenient, it was just like being at home, which our family enjoyed. Elise and Dom were very helpful and accommodating. We would definitely stay at their place again when traveling to the London area."

38610,251226748,07-04-2018,141877928,Fiona,"By London standard Elisa and Dom’s house is quite large. It was perfect for our party of ten. The hosts were amazingly hospitable. Plenty of eatery places, shops and fairly convenient to tube stations. I think a great location for first time visitors who want to access central London sights which are mostly in zones 1 & 2. This house is in zone 2 making public transportation economical."
38610,284175854,01-07-2018,6614976,Caitlin,A very accommodating stay!! Convenient location with Some great restaurants close by. Excellent space for a group of people..we slept 3 couples and an extra 2 adults very comfortably. Great dining space under a glass atrium with nice outdoor sitting area too!
38610,288263443,09-07-2018,158304377,Giovanni,"nous avons passé un super séjour chez Élisa et dom. la maison est idéalement placée pour découvrir Londres, à 5min de la ligne de métro qui fait le tour de la ville. nous avons adoré l'authenticité de la maison, les petites attentions et le calme du quartier."
38610,299698416,31-07-2018,106179953,Manuel,"Muy acogedora. Muy bien situada, con supermercados cerca. Recomendamos utilizar metro muy bien comunicado con el resto de Londres.<br/>Muy agradable el patio posterior y la cocina espectacular"
38610,311974622,22-08-2018,28470584,Ana Luiza,"Elisa & Dom foram extremamente atenciosos e gentis. A casa é muito charmosa e a rua tranquila, apesar de estar em um bairro bem agitado. Não é no centro mas realmente tem boas conexões para os principais pontos de Londres e fazendo baldeação você chega a qualquer lugar. Tínhamos ônibus / metrô sempre disponíveis há menos de 10 minutos. <br/>Na avenida principal tem muitos restaurantes e comércios árabes, libaneses, sírios... É um bairro muito diversificado, com mercados ao ar livre, muitas lojas de conveniência (muitas árabes ) e restaurantes ao virar a esquina. Quando saíamos dessa grande avenida e virávamos a rua, parecíamos que estávamos mudando de bairro. A rua é bem agradável e a vizinhança amigável.  É uma típica casa vitoriana com muitas escadas, sótão e terraço. Muitas obras de arte pela casa. Viajei com os meus filhos pequenos e nos primeiros dias fiquei com receio de tantas escadas mas depois relaxei e resolvi ensinar as crianças a descer com segurança. Como tem muitos objetos de decoração pela casa e não tem quartos no primeiro piso, acredito que não seja o ideal para crianças muito pequenas mas nossa experiência foi muito positiva. "
38610,367279108,04-01-2019,99170848,Louise,Wonderful house in a good location. We were very pleased with everything.
38610,416245021,24-02-2019,100673669,Thomas,"From the moment we entered Elsa &Dom’s house we had a wonderful Holliday in London. Everything we needed was either in the townhouse or within reach just a minute or two walk to grocery stores. We quickly found our that underground stop Shepard’s Bush Marked, a 5 minute walk away took us to wherever we needed, with usually one underground switch along the way. Travelling home after a long day out and about, we usually took the central metro straight to Westfield Mall, a gigantic mall only a 15 minute walk from home. There was  a big grocery store and everything else you could dream of there, even low priced clothing stores.<br/>The town house was located in a very quiet side street, you really get the feeling being in the heart of London, in a very nice area that felt safe. The town house itself had a lot of character, personal with lots of pictures, photos and personal items, the walls filled with images, arts and curiosa. We all spent the late evenings in the beautiful living room, where we could play music on several Bluetooth speakers. They had Netflix and Apple TV, but we never felt the need to turn on the TV. <br/>We were 7 people, ranging from 8 yers old to 75 years old, and we had all our own private spaces in the 5 bedrooms. We made supper every day, and their kitchen had everything we needed of pots and pans, and spices for a range of different meals.<br/>Make note that the outlets are probably different in England. We didn’t bring enough converters for charging all our units, but Elsa&Dom had already thought of that, providing us with a couple of universal outlet converters. <br/>Everything we ever needed was written in their excellent house guide. For anything else, Elsa &Dom was always quick with informative responses. We have absolutely no complains on either the house or the hosts. A fantastic place to experience all of London."
38610,422017184,10-03-2019,6407604,Emily,"We had a lovely stay at Elisa and Dom's home. This is a truly warm and welcoming space: our family of six (four children) plus grandparents had plenty of room to spread out and to enjoy evening meals together after exploring the city during the day. The location is central and handy, though the street itself is very quiet. Elisa and Dom were responsive and made check-in and check-out a breeze."
38610,443626524,26-04-2019,32591469,Leigh,"We really enjoyed our stay at Elisa & Dom's place.  The layout and size of their home was perfect for our 6 adult and 5 children family group.  Their house is a lovely eclectic representation of their lives and really felt like a home and not a sterile environment.   Their kitchen was large enough for us to gather but we could also spread out on the same floor with plenty of space.  The walk from the nearest tube station was very manageable and we initially did a grocery shop at the nearby shopping mall and then filled in our supplies at the smaller shops up and down the street.  We also enjoyed the nearby independent coffee shops and multi cultural neighbourhood vibe.  Elisa and Dom regularly checked in with us to see how we were doing and were very easy going, helpful and friendly.  This was a great home base for us to tour all the major tourist sights and we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a London neighbourhood experience to supplement their London city visit."
38610,460831514,30-05-2019,853983,Richard,"Lovely and comfortable home, lovingly decorated and pristine. Truly a wonderful stay. I would not hesitate to recommend these generous and talented hosts."

38610,520296870,30-08-2019,178602705,Jonathan S,"Eliza and Dom's house is as homely and spacious as the images suggest. It's full of art objects and paintings. Signs of a family who love collecting and making images are everywhere. The kitchen is the centre of the house with the Aga at the centre. If you enjoy cooking & eating, everything you need is here. There's a lovely garden for having a glass of wine in the summer. Two lounges for relaxing with a book or film. (Our kids loved access to Netflix!) <br/>The house is on a quiet tree-lined street in Shepherd's Bush, a wonderfully welcoming community of people from all over the world. We enjoyed trying out Elisa and Dom's restaurant recommendations at least twice (brunch one day, pizza another) and also had fun exploring local shops for fruit and vegetables. Although there are chain supermarkets like Sainsbury's, Tesco's and Waitrose nearby, there's no need to shop there! In terms of location/transport, there are two tube stops close by, Shepherd's Bush Market (6 streets away, 5-10 mins) and Shepherd's Bush (9 streets away, 10-15 mins). Central London is just a few stops away... we were in Covent Garden in 20 minutes! The house was also conveniently located for a family trip to the Harry Potter Studios in Watford!"
38610,546004219,13-10-2019,209250303,Georgette,it is it is a great place to stay in London. Close to the tube. It is a quaint neighborhood very Mary Popin like. They were great hosts
38610,550774552,19-10-2019,1142754,Rhonda,Elisa and Dom’s is an adventure when you walk in the house. The walls are covered with art and collections of different objects. The bedrooms all have their own character. We were a group of five so it was perfect we all had our own room. The kitchen was a great room for all of us to gather. We all enjoyed their home and it made our trip very special. The house itself was very clean. Elisa and Dom communicated very promptly and answered any questions I had. The location was not my favorite but the price was very reasonable and worth the extra walking. Would love to go back.
38610,588309925,04-01-2020,27403418,Natascha,"I booked Elisa & Doms house for our NYE family trip. The house offers plenty of space for a family with 5 different bed rooms upstairs. The living and kitchen area downstairs is big and really lovely for family time. On that note: there is no bedroom on the groundfloor so we gave my father one of the rooms on the first floor as he has problems taking stairs. Keep that in mind if you or travelling partners face difficulties with stairs. <br/>As soon as we walked in we felt at home. Pictures, decorations and furnitures show that this is a house where people live. It is very warm and welcoming. The layout is a typical British row house in a calm side street. So for us it was very authentic. <br/>Communication during our stay was always fast and helpful. We had no problems at all and would book again. <br/>Thank you Elisa & Dom for this wonderful stay."
38610,593917513,17-01-2020,283213328,Laura,Great place to stay. Close access to transportation options. Pleasant atmosphere and  hosts were very helpful.

38610,650157463,12-08-2020,339672556,Erik,"Where should I start... A very welcoming house that is obviously a house people have lived in for years (the furnitures, the pictures... ) and who love to travel internationally.<br/>Way enough room to allow some quiet times even with 5 people when returning from a day walking the city of London. The garden was great to provide some fresh air during the heat waves and allow relaxed diners with the possibility of a bbq. Some appliances are vintage and contribute to the overall charm of the house. Beds are spacious and bathrooms and showers were good.<br/>Elisa & Dom were always quick to answer any questions we had and the house manual was great and included great recommendations. Also some nice attentions like hydroalcoolic gel waiting for us on the dinning table when we arrived.<br/>A very good experience for our group of 5, we can only recommend."
38610,6.84665E+17,02-08-2022,139821983,Jason,"House was great and got a good sense of Elisa and Don’s personality through the pictures and personal touches throughout the house. They checked in on us over the course of the stay. Beds were comfortable, space was ample for our family of four.  House is located on a quiet street the runs into a Main Street with two tube stops and the huge Westfield mall minutes away. Neighborhood was cool and diverse and it was easy to get around London from where we were."
38610,7.63636E+17,19-11-2022,39977722,Asma,"I had such a great time staying at Elisa & Dom’s beautiful home with my family. It is such a homely, comfortable and well decorated house. I enjoyed it very much! A beautiful kitchen where you could relax with your family after a whole day outing! Beautiful cosy  bedrooms and living space. It is exactly how it was described and more! Loved every second of it!<br/>The house was very near groceries, restaurants and Westfield! It was very near to the bus stop and tube stations which made it so easy for us to get around.<br/>Elisa& Dom were very great hosts who provided me with very detailed instructions and information about the house. It was easy to communicate with them. They were always just a click away. Would definitely recommend their place to all! Thank you so much Dom & Elisa for your very kind hospitality"
38610,7.85375E+17,19-12-2022,226367,Tracy,"Great position, neighbors, grocery shop, transport nearby (trains/buses). House not well maintained.  Owners stated it’s 150 years old (our home >120 years with no such issues). Problems were renovated items, not original. Booked for2 showers (5 people), both had issues, only one working at time, 1 day none. Waited days for fix. Host adamant no need of 2 showers, issue of contractual obligation. Major heating problem, thermostat unreliable, temperature mostly<15C. Cracks in floors, significant draft issues. Listing no mention owner charges extra if “standard” energy use exceeded. Seems waived this time. Poor energy efficiency. Mattresses sloppy, 1 bulging springs. Iron&board missing, told to borrow neighbors, hosts don’t iron, feel no-one should. Crockery dirty, dishwasher needed filter clean. There were other considerable maintenance issues that don’t fit 1000 character limit. Hosts condescending in contact. Host seeking care for a poorly maintained house, us paying for the privilege."
38610,7.97707E+17,05-01-2023,58939944,Terri,"We had a lovely stay here. Elisa was communicative, responsive and friendly. It felt like our home away from home with lots of interesting photos and decor. It was very comfortable and we particularly loved gathering in the kitchen. We each had our space to relax and regroup after a long day of visiting and walking. Getting around London was easy with tube station and bus stops nearby. We loved exploring Uxbridge street and visiting the shops and restaurants there. We also talked to a policeman who explained to us the logistics of handling opposing football fans exiting the stadium, which is very close to the house but you’d never know a game was going on from the inside, we just happened to be returning from a day trip. To sum it all up, lovely stay!!"

The apartment was very easy to find and within walking distance to Queens Road Station and trendy Peckham with its buzzing night life offering an amazing range of cafes, restaurants and bars. <br/>The room was spacious, bright and airy, with a comfy bed dressed with white bed linen. Overall the apartment is very well maintained, the kitchen and bathroom were spotless, so everything you need for your stay was taken care of. <br/>Transport links into central London are good with regular buses into the city centre. The Overground train service is a few mins walk, regular trains make it quite easy to get around London.<br/>Thanks again César, I will definitely stay with you on my return trip later this year. it was definitely good value for money."

La habitación es grande,  luminosa y muy confortable, incluyendo extras como un gran televisor y lector de DVD’s.

He was comprehensive with his check-in instructions, comfortable place to stay and provided a simple but very welcome breakfast that I was able to make for myself in the morning. The location was close to the bus routes, and not far from the Overground. The neighbourhood was quiet, I wasn't disturbed by traffic noise. The apartment was warm and did not have any smoke, damp or cooking odours. Shoes off at the door meant that Cesar took cleanliness seriously."

Foi oferecido toalhas limpas e cobertor extra caso houvesse frio. O café da manhã é bem simples (café ou chá, leite de soja, frutas e aveia instantânea) mas  perto do local existe supermercado, assim facilita a compra de lanches extras caso precise. As portas não possuem tranca, inclusive o banheiro. Por isso me senti varias vezes incomodada de não ter privacidade e segurança de tomar banho sem ser surpreendida. Porém não tivemos nenhum problema. Há 10 min a pé existe um centro comercial com mercado popular, shoppingcenter, varias lojas e lanchonetes. O apartamento é bem localizado, por isso a todo tempo existem ônibus de acesso direto para o centro de Londres (Cerca 35-40 min). De modo geral foi uma experiência muito boa."

38995,8.88262E+17,10-05-2023,9596388,Nicholas,"Cesar was perfect: very flexible for our arrival and departure, discreet and nearly invisible during our stay. We felt at home and will gladly return for our next stay near Peckham."
38995,8.9551E+17,20-05-2023,40003359,Merlin,Wir hatten einen netten Aufenthalt bei Cesar. Cesar war sehr nett und war immer gut erreichbar sodass alles reibungslos geklappt hat. <br/>Es gab sogar ein kleines Frühstück welches wir uns schnell zubereiten konnten.<br/>Die direkte Umgebung gibt nicht besonders viel her. Dennoch findet man Möglichkeiten zum einkaufen und zum Essen. Die Unterkunft ist sehr gut angebunden und man ist schnell in der Innenstadt mit dem Bus oder der U-Bahn. <br/>Das Zimmer und die Wohnung ist sehr geräumig und sauber sodass wir uns sehr Wohlgefühl haben.
38995,9.01333E+17,28-05-2023,206213642,Lena,Cesar was super friendly and showed us everything in the apartment. We were able to check in a little earlier and had a lot of peace in the apartment. Even a small breakfast was ready for us. Thanks again for everything :)
38995,9.04271E+17,01-06-2023,74669769,James,"Cesar was a brilliant host! He was very friendly, welcoming and responsive and was flexible with check-in times and changes to my journey. The location is very convenient; a quiet area only 5/10 mins from the nearest station/bus stop. The bed was comfortable too with a nice spacious room. Cesar talked me through everything too so there were no surprises when using anything in the flat! I definitely had one of the best night sleeps of any airbnb I've used in London and great value for money! Thank you and will definitely visit again when needed!"
38995,9.0567E+17,03-06-2023,188474870,Diego,Cesar was perfect and the location is safe and clean ( well connected with public transport too)
38995,9.12898E+17,13-06-2023,275782343,Emilia,"We're happy with our stay and can absolutely recommend this to anyone visiting London. The room was very clean and the apartment had everything you would need during your stay. 24/7 bus stop straight to the center nearby.<br/>Cesar was friendly, polite and made sure we had the most out of our stay giving us guidance about transportation and the neighbourhood. He was very flexible with our check in and check our schedules. Felt safe and welcomed."
38995,9.15784E+17,17-06-2023,274505830,Yukie,"Cesar is the best host ever. He is a really beautiful person and so helpful. <br/>His flat is modern, well-furnished, and very very clean. <br/>The room is luminous and spacious! I loved his place! <br/>If you are considering visiting London, this is the best place. <br/>Muchos Gracias Cesare!"
38995,9.16539E+17,18-06-2023,118053305,Jason,Cesar made us feel welcome and provided a very clean and tidy apartment!  Great location and Cesar is a very nice guy!

Cesar ist klar, freundlich, unterstützend und hat an alles gedacht. Sehr entspannende Tage , danke . Johannes und Anne"
38995,9.5056E+17,04-08-2023,112573740,Benjamin,Cesar’s place was very cozy and just as described in the listing. Amenities were lovely and he communicates very well and quickly. Highly recommend and a quick trip right into the heart of London.
38995,9.86868E+17,23-09-2023,17887603,Marco,"stanza molto bella, grande, pulita e silenziosa. il centro turistico si raggiunge in circa 30 minuti con bus o treno. ci sono mezzi anche durante la notte. Cesar è molto disponibile e gentile. ottima soluzione per qualche giorno a Londra!"
38995,9.90438E+17,28-09-2023,7770185,Lloyd,"Cesar was very accommodating, responsive to messages prior to acceptance and flexible with check in/out times. Also a friendly person and nice to talk to. Flat was easy to find and clean. Bedroom was tidy clean and had a TV and on a relatively quiet street so not much noise in the evenings. Towels were provided as well as coffee made for me in the morning. Flat is a few mins walk away from numerous bus routes down Old Kent Road which get you to central london in 20 mins or Peckham overground station. Many thanks!"
38995,9.92591E+17,01-10-2023,87499472,Marco,Cesar was best host ever. Friendly and always smiley. I had a problem with the flight and he was very helpful to arrange a new check in solution. We had coffe together in the morning and we also had the chance to have some interesting talk. The house was cozy and clean. Definitely recommended! ✌🏻
38995,1.01007E+18,25-10-2023,218418644,Chandrasekhar,"Cesar is a great responsive and friendly host. His flat was pristine clean and felt at home. It’s located in a calm location but still pretty close to a main road with full of shops such as Lidl, ASDA, many food take aways, bus stops.<br/>I’d strongly recommended César’s place to everyone and will return to his place in future.<br/>Cheers,<br/>Chandra"
38995,1.02308E+18,12-11-2023,124484441,Brian,"My stay at Cesar's home, while short, was great. He was, firstly, very helpful with check-in, as my flight was arriving late at night, but he helped me with instructions for the most efficient combination of public transport to reach his home and communicated back and forth with me as I made my way from airport, to the various metro lines, to his home.<br/>The home is just as described in the listing, with accurate pictures. The location is good, and one I chose purposely to be in a quieter area to insure I got some good sleep (this was the last leg of a longer vacation). If you're good at public transport, this will be no issue at all and you can reach central London in no time, even if you take one of the bus lines. If you're someone who needs to constantly return to your hotel/Airbnb, I'd probably recommend booking an Airbnb closer to central London, but if you're like me and just leave for the day and only come back to sleep, Cesar's place is a great choice.<br/>5/5 stars"
38995,1.03835E+18,03-12-2023,17185805,María,We could not have been happier staying with Cesar. His flat is super clean and the bed is amazing. We slept like babies. <br/>It was very handy to be able make coffee in the morning and Cesar even left us little breakfast. Cesar is very friendly and warm and a fantastic host. We are definitely staying again. 12 out of 10.
39387,14402465,18-06-2014,11785170,Kseniya,"Мы гостили у Алека 8 дней и всем остались довольны.<br/>Прекрасная комната со всеми удобствами. Алек оказался очень гостеприимным и приветливым хозяином, разрешил нам пользоваться кухней и всеми удобствами квартиры. От этого места можно легко добраться до центра Лондона на метро или автобусе, но мы очень часто ходили пешком. Рядом есть красивый канал, где можно погулять и много мест для перекуса. Несколько супермаркетов и рынок в 3 минутах ходьбы."
39387,15147847,03-07-2014,4416419,Simone,"Spent 12 nights in this room, what can I say, it was like being at home. It is very bright and cosy. The sofa bed is VERY comfy, and the pillow was soft just as I like it (I'm picky with pillows!).<br/><br/>The kitchen has everything you need, microwaves and oven are great.<br/><br/>The area is awesome, I've used to live there so I knew how it was but for someone new in London I can say this area is definitely one of the best, it is well served by buses and metro (Westbourne  is the closest, or for a short walk there is Kilburn park, Maida vale and Warwick Avenue )<br/><br/>The host, Alec, is very welcoming and he is a great person, even if he was out most of the time.<br/><br/>I will definitely consider to come back here if I will come back in London in the future."
39387,20532340,30-09-2014,7236434,Eneida,"We stayed 2 weeks at Alec’s place and we really enjoyed our stay there. The place is very bright and you have almost everything you need. It is quite spacey and warm. The location is very convenient since the house is located just 5 min walk to bus station and 10 min walk to the nearest tube station. There are many shops, supermarkets and restaurants / bars nearby in walking distance. Alec has been very friendly and helpful during our stay and we definitely recommend his house to anyone visiting London in the future."
39387,49718506,05-10-2015,35192923,Adriana,"Alec was very welcoming! We arrived at his place very late in the night and he waited for us. The communication before arriving was excellent, and he even explained via email all the transports and coincidences we needed to take to reach his place. He explained all we needed to know about the house and he was very open to help us. It could have been more clean, but for a short stay for 2 people is acceptable. The neighbourhood is quiet and very close to transports (1min walk to the closer bus station and 4min walk from tube station on the CircleLine)! Can recommend it."
39387,50123970,09-10-2015,7907432,Marie,"I recommend Alec's place for a short quiet stay in London, it's 10min walk to the tube and 5min to bus stations. It responds exactly to the pictures, clean and neat with a notting hillish charm that makes you feel at home. The bed is very comfortable, the room is big and spacious and has lots of natural light which you can enjoy during the day. And lots of stylish paintings all around the flat!"
39387,271486618,01-06-2018,187352654,Christopher,"Alec is a great host, lovely flat, quick run around with a brush and mop but that could just be my slight OCD. I stayed here while working shifts in the city and it was never a problem me coming and going at different hours. Full use of the flat, with a good sofa bed. I would definitely recommend and would stay again no problems."
39387,290942297,15-07-2018,23221601,Dusan,"Alex was a very nice host. The flat was well situated and decorated with style. I would recommend a quick run with mop and the vacuum cleaner, but that's just me =)."
39387,477015059,27-06-2019,134805928,Benjamin,Alec’s place had everything you’d need and more to end and start you day in peace and comfort. I only met him the first day as he was busy elsewhere for the rest of my stay but he was generous enough to trust me his appartment and make sure I had all I needed. As a side note I do have to tell the bed was not the most comfortable if that’s important to you.
39387,539895671,02-10-2019,292168461,Fatima,"Alec is a good and friendly host.Great  stay , good value  for money."

41311,97526,15-09-2010,181603,David,"Staying here was really excellent.  The location was great, about 15-20 minutes to all of the places we wanted to visit.  In addition, it was very easy to find her house using the map from this website.  Grace was a great host and both my wife and I found it very comfortable staying here.  She had lots of food for breakfast, snacks, etc.  Overall, I would recommend Grace's house to anyone.  Thanks so much!"
41311,103245,23-09-2010,195347,Ulrike,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and wow - it could not have started better. Grace is such a charming, warm and welcoming person with a big, fantastic smile. She was always very helpful and I felt immediately at home. The house is very clean and  my room was spacious with lots of storage space. She provides so many extras which you would not get in a B&B or Hotel. It was great coming home and having the possibility to make myself a tea or cook something. I travalled alone this time and walked home from the bus/tube at night, which felt quite safe. Golders Green/Brent Cross is an interesting area and there are many different ways by bus or tube to get into Central London. Brent Cross Shopping Center is just 10min by foot and the charming old suburban village of Hampstead just one tube stop away. I would love to come back soon and stay with Grace again. "
41311,113077,06-10-2010,239696,Jen,"Grace was a wonderful host, the home was lovely, clean and perfect in every way! The neighborhood is quiet and filled with families so it feels safe and a perfect oasis from the rush of central London. When I return to London, I will gladly stay at Grace's place. Merci!"
41311,142273,21-11-2010,232310,Maneesh,"This was my first experience of airbnb in London, having used the service in the US in the summer of 2010. Everything was as described, and Grace is a very generous host and the house has a welcoming atmosphere. I have ended up staying far longer than I originally expected, because it's such a comfortable, clean and quiet place. "
41311,154890,17-12-2010,211250,Lauren, We have just finished our tour of Europe and starting off by staying with grace was awesome. She was so kind and friendly and we could have not asked for a better host. Her house is so clean and bedroom was large and the bed was comfy. Breakfast was great and being able to use the kitchen was very handy. Very close to Brent cross station and area is safe. would highly recommend to others to stay here without hesitation. Thank you grace!  
41311,158999,27-12-2010,251884,Oleksiy,"It was my first experience with AirBNB and I've got more than I expected.<br/>Grace is a great host and a charming personality.<br/>The location is very convenient and the room is quiet and clean.<br/>Would definitely recommend the place to anyone, unless you are going to book it for the time of my next trip to London. "
41311,167432,07-01-2011,314448,Hester,"Staying in Grace's house was a joy because Grace is a lovely, internationally minded host and her house is very quiet (located on a quiet street; we were staying in the double room upstairs), comfortable and clean. We were given the freedom to come and go as we pleased. Wonderful breakfast – at the disposal of the guests in the fridge were eggs, ham, various fruitjuices, cereals, yoghurt, etc etc. Nice to be able to cook something at night as well. We were even given the use of the salon if we wanted, which we didn't because London has so much to offer, but the thought was lovely. (I myself forgot to ask, but if you want to use internet, be sure to bring a laptop.)<br/>An ample 5 minutes walk from tube station Brent Cross (about 25 minutes from tube Leicester Square), and from a huge Tesco supermarket (good and well priced) that is almost continuously open (to be reached via a tunnel under the motorway). We didn't try the bus connections in the neighbourhood but to our knowledge they are plenty and there might even be a night service.<br/>Hop off some time at tube Hampstead – very recommendable neighbourhood with a 'Charles Dickens' atmosphere in the sidestreets and beautiful historic properties which seem unchanged for centuries, pubs (Holly Bush). Also Hampstead Heath (woods and fields) nearby for a nice, wholesome walk."
41311,172947,21-01-2011,303133,Dawn,"Grace was a wonderful host!  I appreciate her willingness to share her home and make us feel welcome. I enjoyed getting to know her a bit and have a few fun conversations!  Our room was spacious, clean and neat. There was a central bathroom for us to share.  Grace was generous with her entire home.  The walk from the tube station to her home was not too far, about 6 blocks.  Not too much fun in the rain with suitcases, but very manageable.  Very easy to get to central London and to the local Tesco grocery store (about a 5 minute walk from her home.)    I would absolutely recommend Grace as a host and her home as a place to stay while in beautiful London!  Thank you, Grace.  Our stay was lovely!!  We had blast!!"
41311,182117,14-02-2011,362324,Marilyn,"Grace runs a lovely bnb which is clean, tidy and great place to stay! Grace is a delightful host who has made my stay fantastic.  If you are thinking about staying here do! <br/><br/>close to walk from the tube.  Tesco supermarket near by.  safe area.  I have been out running in this neighborhood while I stayed.  <br/><br/>This has been a great airbnb experience. Thank you Grace!  "
41311,207911,24-03-2011,321457,Amir,"For me this trip to London was a beautiful thing. And then to stay in graces was a complete joy. it is quiet, clean and very well reserved in as far as she keeps her whole home. yes it is like being amongst the family you can tolerate and don't mind being with. lol. but seriously Grace is a very nice person and fun to talk with though i made jokes most of the time with her. I would highly recommend a long term stay or even one night if you are passing through London... you will enjoy the community as well. everything is with in walking distance. Thank you grace... I will be back..."
41311,236669,23-04-2011,507996,Clare,"Staying with Grace was wonderful! Her house is lovely - just as pictured - and the room is a wonderful size. It's in a nice quiet area and the bed was really comfy too. There were lots of different things provided for breakfast, and there was free wifi. Grace was lovely - friendly and helpful. I would definitely recommend staying with Grace."
41311,409671,31-07-2011,666703,Himari Roswitha,"Darta and I had a beautiful experience at Graces place. Grace is preparing and doing everything with so much care and love, that it's a real pleasure being there! The place is spotlessly clean and the breakfast has a generous variety, Seeing how Grace is doing everything is a real inspiration! Big thumb up and a warm thank you!"
41311,669135,27-10-2011,1248460,Maya,"Grace was a fantastic host! She was very warm and friendly and made us feel very comfortable.

It is about 10 min walk to the tube underground station, which can be quite a far walk during winter! Thanks Grace for the great stay!"
41311,1889531,05-08-2012,1976502,Vivek,Great overall first experience on airbnb many thanks to Grace! We were in London for the Olympics. Location is walking distance to Underground station and supermarket. Facilities and rooms are clean and well-maintained. Grace is nice and friendly. HIghly recommended.
41311,3542570,14-02-2013,3353966,Aurore,"I spent a very nice stay in that lovely, clean and tidy place. Pictures are the reality. The room was warm enough with the bad cold outside, and quiet, the refrigerator is full of many welcoming breakfasts :)<br/>Grace is a honest, respectful and direct person, what I really appreciate. We had fun talking politics, celebrity gossips, cinema, etc. Grace and Bobo are always making you feel home and asking about your day. <br/>I definitely recommend her place for your London trip, especially when my previous London exp/place has been a huge mistake!<br/>Thank you very much Grace!! "
41311,4752346,23-05-2013,1244539,Andrew,"For whatever reason you may be coming to London, this is a nearly ideal place to stay. The host, Grace, is absolutely tops -- kind, thoughtful, considerate, and willing to help you out with whatever your tourist or travel needs are. The rooms themselves are sparkling clean, with very comfortable beds and good spaces to work. There is a full-fledged spacious kitchen to share. Bathrooms are fully operative, clean, and there are two so there's no crowding. Best of all, the house is really just a short walk from the Tube on the Northern Line, and it gets you into central London in less than 30 minutes. I had no trouble getting to the house with my bags from the Tube on foot. Strongly recommend this experience as has been one of my best ones on Airbnb."
41311,4986937,05-06-2013,6005676,Samantha,"Grace was truly amazing. She explained to us how to get to her house before we even left our home. We were given everything we needed for our stay, including breakfast everyday, great recommendations about places to see and eat at as well as how to get there. The location of her house is far enough out of town that it is a nice quiet get away from the city, but does not make for a long commute. The house was always very clean and comfortable. I would be happy to stay with Grace again and highly recommend anyone going to London to stay with her too!"
41311,5018814,08-06-2013,1527831,Dan,"Grace's hospitality started even before I landed in London, when she ordered a taxi to pick me up from the airport. Her home is right next to Brent Cross tube station, and it takes about 20 minutes to get into central London. The room and entire house is very clean and user-friendly, and there is even cereal which guests are invited to eat for breakfast. If you are looking for an affordable, comfortable and convenient place to stay in London, this is definitely the way to go."
41311,5644922,09-07-2013,6964920,Peter,"I felt extremely comfortable at Grace's place!.<br/>Grace is a great hostess, always very friendly, helpful and in a good, positive mood. <br/>The room was very big and clean. Good idea to take off one shoes before entering the house - thus the carpet remain clean and you feel comfortable.<br/>Also the bathroom was very clean although several people used it. <br/>Breakfast was perfect for me - the frige was filled with bread, jam, cheese etc.<br/>You get to the next tube station Brent Cross or Golders Green in 10 - 15 minutes by walk. From there you can take tube or bus to get to Central London. The distance is not that far - at midnight you can take the night bus back to Golders Green and then just ten minutes walk back to Grace's home in a peaceful neighborhood. I also like the atmosphere of Golders Green with many different shops, cafes and many different people. Even at midnight I was not afraid to walk there on my own.<br/><br/>I can highly recommend to stay at Grace's home. <br/><br/>"
41311,6975851,01-09-2013,8428780,Ludwig,"Grace war eine sehr freundliche Gastgeberin. Das Zimmer war sehr ordentlich und auch sehr sauber.

41311,21076439,11-10-2014,19173203,Ory And Vicktoria,"We stayed at Grace's place for ~3 weeks, and it was really great. The house is kept tidy and clean, everything is as it appears in the photos, and the same goes for the detailed information. Grace, and the other inhabitants of the house, were all friendly and of positive attitude. Nevertheless, privacy is retained, and everything runs streamlined. Making dinners is simple, as the kitchen is fully fitted, and storage room is available in the fridge. It was also possible to use the washing machine, the iron, and living room. The breakfast supply is always full. <br/><br/>Grace's place is strategically located. It is easy to get to central London by tube. There is a huge shopping centre minutes walk, and a giant Tessco shop even closer. The area itself is very quite, but still at a short walking distance you have various caffes and resturaunts. <br/><br/>On a personal note, Grace is a warm, interesting, and cool person, with allot to give to this world. <br/>The natural,  yet super-professional, way in which Grace hosts complete strangers in her house is quite remarkable. We were lucky to get to know her a bit. We feel that she really helped us out in all sorts of ways, beyond what may be expected.<br/><br/>We recommend anyone coming to london to try and stay with Grace, there really are no downsides. "

В ванной комнате все шампуни-гели и прочее можно использовать (а я не знала, и привезла свое). Дали 2 чистых полотенца для меня и МЧ, через неделю поменяли их и постельное белье. <br/>На кухне в большом холодильнике много соков и воды, на полочках каши-чай-кофе-шоколадная паста-специи-масло, в общем, всем можно пользоваться, все можно кушать, можно готовить. Главное-чисто убираться потом=)<br/>Район довольно отдаленный от центра, но в то же время и цена более, чем приятная. На метро по черной ветке до всех достопримечательностей около 30 минут. Ночью ходит ночной автобус номер N5.<br/>В общем, впечатления самые положительные.<br/>Единственный нюанс-так как поездка была в ноябре, ночью в доме было довольно холодно. Но Грейс сказала, что это можно отрегулировать. Однако посреди ночи я всегда ленилась. Мне было проще протянуть руку за свитером=)"
41311,22779079,14-11-2014,3734865,Rory,"Grace is a great host. I stayed in her home for a few nights when I returned to london. I lived in the area for years so I knew it was a good location, safe, quiet area with good links to Central london. The room was big and clean. I really enjoyed my stay and Grace was really nice and helpfull. When I return to london to visit friends I will definately be looking to stay with Grace."
41311,22900215,17-11-2014,1318528,Elisa,"Grace was a lovely host and a very creative person. She was very friendly and explained very clear to me how to arrive at her house. Once arrived, she was very warm and I felt myself very welcome. The room was large, comfortable and clean and the rest of the house has a nice appearance. It was great the guests could use the kitchen and we could even make some breakfast, which I liked very much."

There are cereals, jams, bread and more for breakfast. The neighborhood is very quite even on day time.

The house is situated in 15-min walk to Golders Green station, in a lovely family area. <br/>Grace was very friendly and welcoming. Although the room (#2) looks more spacious and bright in the picture, my parents really enjoyed it as it was very clean, warm and cosy. <br/>The whole house is super clean and quiet. A very good value for money!"

There is a Tesco near by the house.<br/>so it's convient to get simple meal or snack.<br/>I could not see her oftenly. but I could feel her warmness.<br/>She helped and advices me in practice.<br/>anyway i miss london and her house.<br/>Another guest who i met at that stay said to me.<br/>""Grace's house is clean and neat, it reflects her mind.""<br/>it is really true.<br/>many thanks, Grace.<br/>i wish to see you soon.<br/>"

She's responsive, understanding and eager to help. If you like to keep to yourself, she also respects that. Her place is as described, very clean and cosy. A 7 minute walk to Brent cross station  which has a 32+ minutes train ride to Tottenham Court Road. The area is safe and quiet. I would definitely recommend this place to other people.

Para empezar llegamos con bastante retraso y nos estuvo esperando hasta bien entrada la noche, sin ningún problema, con una amplia sonrisa que nos abrió, así es ella.

Grace's house is spacious and very clean, she took really good care of the house. The kitchen is equipped with many cookware and utensil which makes it easy to cook. The house is within walking distance to the tube station and Tesco superstore. For those who don't mind walking a bit longer (around 20-30 mins), there is also a large Chinese supermarket Wing Yip and Brent Cross Shopping Center around. I will definitely recommend Grace's place."

She's also very helpful in giving me a tour around the house ! Her airbnb is very homely and I will definitely recommend her place to my friends in the future !

Tutto perfettamente funzionante e riscaldamento disponibile a qualsiasi ora del giorno. La casa è situata tra Brent cross e Golders Green (zona che personalmente apprezzo e considero tranquilla). Grace è stata molto disponibile nel fornirmi le chiavi in mattinata, causa problemi di arrivo a Londra per il mio ragazzo ed è stata una persona davvero piacevole. Se cercate un ambiente accogliente e famigliare lo consiglio!"

41311,504146583,07-08-2019,130011801,Karen,"The pictures are accurate, the room I was staying in was very spacious. When I found out that it was on the first floor, I was a bit concerned as my luggage was quite bulky and heavy. However, Grace kindly offered to help me take my luggage up the stairs so it was not a major struggle for me. Check-in was a breeze, I arrived earlier than planned but Grace kindly allowed me to sit and wait in the lounge rather than outside. There is only one bathroom that was shared among four people (including myself) during my stay. However, the others were out a lot so I never really experienced any inconvenience with the toilet availability. There is another toilet in the house, which is useful when the bathroom is occupied. I really like the garden out back and spent some time there occasionally. The area is quiet and peaceful, which I appreciate in a place like London where blaring  sirens are a norm. The only sounds you hear are the birds chirping in the morning, which is absolutely lovely to wake up to. Short walk to the nearest tube station and a large Tesco is close by for groceries. Really enjoyed my stay here and Grace is a really friendly and easygoing host. If I return to London, I would definitely stay here again. :)"

41311,564577629,16-11-2019,52508431,Wei Kuan,Staying for almost two months with zero problem. <br/>The place is very clean and it have almost very things you need for living. Just a few minutes walk to Brent Cross underground station and bus to Oxford Street. <br/>Grace is very friendly and helpful! Highly recommend!!!
41311,587668652,03-01-2020,170874028,Addison,"Lived at Grace's place for 6 weeks while completing a short exchange at UCL.<br/>Grace was an excellent host, always friendly and happy to give tips about london, but also giving you privacy. Her place was always very clean, cosy with fast wi-fi. <br/>The room is larger than expected, bigger than most in european hotels. The bed is comfy and furniture was ageing but functional. Only small downside to the room was it was next to the bathroom upstairs, so you can faintly here the shower and people using the toilet at night.<br/>Located in Brent cross which is quite far from the city centre. However, it was only an 8 min from the tube station which has trains coming every 3 min to Central London starting early in the morning (very convenient). It is also less than a 10min walk to the tesco superstore via an underpass which has almost everything. Neighbourhood felt less affluent but definitely quiet and safe. <br/>Overall, would highly recommend Grace's place, especially considering the price!"
41311,594275681,18-01-2020,327459581,Oscar,Everything spot on. Very helpful
41445,1192073,28-04-2012,1038400,Dele,John was a good host and made sure we had all we needed. Great space and location. Ideal for young and old alike. Easy commute to London from Mill Hill Broadway or Edgware station.  
41445,1877798,03-08-2012,2916235,Elaine,"This place was perfect. Everything was close to public transportation and neighborhood was so nice and quiet. The locals are very friendly and made us feel welcomed. I cannot wait to come back next year. John was excellent with communications with us. He checked in on us to make sure we are ok and everything was exactly what he told us was going to be. It was are our little home away from home.<br/>Thanks John!"
41445,3096401,16-12-2012,4030051,Sophia,"On arrival the place was very clean & tidy - great first impressions. Flat was a lovely size with everything one would require (kettle, toaster, microwave, towels etc) Location was great too, easy to get to Mill Hill Bdwy & Edgware.  "
41445,4095465,09-04-2013,5192906,Jeremy,"Comfortable clean and convenient flat with easy access to central London. Very warm welcome from John.<br/>We would certainly come and stay again next time we are in the Uk."
41445,5897640,21-07-2013,7460562,Mirabel,"We had a great time while staying in Johns apartment. The appartment is approx 7mins to mill hill broadway station. The value for price is very good. <br/>John's flat is nice and confortable. <br/>A pleasure to stay!"
41445,5901782,21-07-2013,4657387,Michaela,"Positive: <br/>Before our arrival communication with John was fast, friendly and cooperative. Check-in 1 day earlier and late check-in no problem.  Internet connection working very fast. Nice residential area. <br/>Negative:<br/>Court & garden much nicer/bigger on the pictures than they are. Rooms much smaller than on the photos and really run down. Mattresses saggy, springs coming through.<br/>Flat was smelly. Doors, radiators and furniture dirty/sticky throughout. Kitchen was the worst, nearly impossible to ever get it clean again without heavy chemicals: cooker hood totally greasy, also the oven and cupboards in/outside, thick limestone all over the sink. Spider webs on walls/ceiling, wallpapers came off. Pans, pots, dishes dirty. Floors in all rooms not vacuumed in months, bed linen and towels definitely not fresh.<br/>Hallway outside the flat smelling from cooking and people smoking inside the house which was forbidden per the house rules. No one cared, smoke came in through our door. <br/>Next day we asked John to come over to discuss issues with the flat - I was very friendly in comparison to the condition of the apartment. John said he wouldn't come that day but only the ""next few days"" and if this flat was not OK for us he would be happy to give us the money back. I was very surprised about his answer as he hadn't even asked what the issues were. <br/>As Airbnb policy is to register complaints within 24 hours I insisted on him coming the same day. I asked him why he wasn't interested in our claims or in trying to solve them. He didn't offer cleaning, instead repeated he would prefer to give us the money back as the flat wasn't suitable for us (which I never said). It appeared the place was for low budget people rather than a holiday/business apartment and that we didn’t suit the apartment. <br/>We lost 3 days of our business stay discussing with John and finding another place, had many troubles, also financially. No one expects to pay two flats at once!<br/>I don't understand Jeremy’s comment of April 2013 that the flat was clean. We checked in on 27th May. There's no way that this dirt was from normal usage in one month. It seemed this flat got renovated some years ago, since then never thoroughly cleaned by/between tenants. It definitely hasn't been cleaned in months or the last tenant messed it up completely in just one month which would be really admirable. Other possibility is that the newer comments are fake.<br/>However Airbnb customer care was good and reliable. They sticked to their policies they advertise on their website. They were available per e-mail, answered in a reasonable amount of time and refunded us the money without problems. <br/>"
41445,6284543,06-08-2013,7495533,Emma,"The apartment was very nice and located nicely near public transport facilities. In my opnion the apartment was nice and clean and the pictures give an accurate image of what you get. John was very helpfull and friendly. We had a lovely stay and would be happy to stay here again. <br/><br/>I've read Michaela's story and was very suprised since we were there in the same month. Everything she mentioned wasn't a problem during our stay. The apartment seemed clean and the neighbours were very nice and did not smoke as far as I noticed."
41445,6846670,27-08-2013,6822349,Simon,"Hi, John was a kind host. We met at the train station and he drove us during a work break to his apartment. We were given two sets of keys and then he said goodbye. We had a kitchen, a living room, two bedrooms and a bathroom. There was a nice view of the garden from the main bedroom and the living room. There were wooden blinds in the kitchen and living room. The floors were clean and there was a fast Internet connection. The second bedroom had a computer and two separate beds. All linen had been fitted prior to our stay.<br/>We have to say that the house had tidied up. however, clean-wise, it wasn't what we were accustomed to at home. We cleaned the kitchen surfaces once we arrived with cleaning liquid supplied. We also cleaned the bathroom, as it had been cleaned before we arrived, but not deep cleaned for a while. <br/>We only used the stand alone wardrobes in the main bedroom as there was a lot of Mould in the second bedroom, especially in the wardrobe. My wife has allergies to mould, so this wasn't good. <br/>A few days before we were due to leave. John wanted to enquire when we were leaving, so we said 10. We were heading into london that day. We couldn't leave until 10:30 in the end. We heard a knock on the door and there was a family wanting to look around our apartment! They were here to meet John, but neither of us could contact him. I feel our valuables may have had been visible if John was going to show people around without our knowledge!<br/>We enjoyed the use of the washing machine and tumble dryer and appreciated that John had bought bread and milk for our arrival.

41445,121446113,17-12-2016,58874832,Huma,"John's flat is both comfortable and convenient. The flat is fully equipped for long term and short term stays. It is located in an ideal spot, very close to Mill Hill Broadway station and shops, post office, hairdressers etc.<br/>The neighbours are also friendly and welcoming. Parking can be a bit tight but the main road can also be used for parking."
41445,125326180,05-01-2017,87360565,Kadijah,We loved our flat in Mill Hill. Even though it was more in greater London area and took 45 to 1 hour to get to central London. We had a wonderful Christmas there and decorated a bit. John was very helpful  letting us check in very late and even stock the fridge a little bit for us. We appreciated having all the necessary tools to cool and make a lovely Christmas dinner. My children enjoyed the home very much. Would definitely stay here again. <br/>
41445,126622877,13-01-2017,22171357,Nicola,Great place - I would certainly recommend John's place

41445,222955450,31-12-2017,160143834,Catherine,"John's place was very clean and with all the amenities.  It was very warm which was a welcome attribute especially in the middle of winter.  The place was cosy.  It felt safe and extremely comfortable.  John was an excellent host.  He responded to texts/questions rapidly and trod the fine line between being polite, attending to every need without being intrusive.  At no time did I feel that I was invading his ""space"".  The flat was designed in a tasteful/neutral way.  The location was convenient with buses going to Edgware just outside the door and you could walk to the local Marks and Spencer.  I would highly recommend John's place."

41509,316863,15-06-2011,368016,Daniel,"Peter was an amazing host, very helpful with advice on where and what to visit in London.  A true gentleman.  The place is beautiful and very central to Chiswick and public transport, exactly what we were after.  A pleasure to stay."
41509,363163,09-07-2011,594964,Mario,"I stayed at Peter beautiful house, in an amazingly quiet part of London, for one night. His kindness has been very important especially after my long flight from NY. The room very cosy and the terrace a hidden jewel!! Thank you so much!! <br/><br/><br/><br/>"
41509,537769,16-09-2011,556293,Justin,"Excellent location right next to the tube and convenient access from Heathrow. Cool, quirky space just out of the centre of Chiswick."
41509,2007069,16-08-2012,3214986,Jonathan,"Peter was an excellent, wonderful host.  Very good communication, highly thoughtful, and graciously hospitable.  I would gladly stay again, and am happy to recommend him to anyone!"

41509,2579074,11-10-2012,1997416,Sofia,We had a very nice stay in Peter's home. He was very helpful and thoughtful. And Chiswick is a great area... The centre is far enough for it to be quiet and safe but close enough to be reached by tube or bus without a problem. 
41509,4099825,09-04-2013,5034189,Lenfant,"Hôte très sympa, qui nous a laissé quasiment tout son appartement durant le WE. Chambre confortable, bien chauffée. Situation près d'une station de métro, quartier très sympa avec plein de restos et autres magasins. A conseiller."
41509,4423744,04-05-2013,5479513,Roslyn (Roz),Peter's apartment was easy to reach on the tube from Heathrow with only one change required and a short walk from Turnham Green Station. Although I arrived earlier than expected Peter was very welcoming and gave the tour of his home etc before getting ready for work. The room was bright and cozy and the bed very comfortable with the bathroom on the same level.  Chiswick is a great location for visiting the sights of the city or to have coffee or a meal close by.
41509,4654205,18-05-2013,2499079,Fiona,"Fitted the bill perfectly, Peter was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. Thanks Peter!"
41509,4822883,27-05-2013,6393995,Stephen,"We had a great time. Peter's place is very well situated -- we came in from Stansted and left through Heathrow and both airports were easy to access via the Tube. Peter was welcoming when we arrived, sitting down with us a drawing a map of the sites and nearby restaurants (he provided excellent food recommendations). Our room was comfortable and quiet. There were other guests while we were there we saw them only briefly -- which was too bad because they were great to talk to! "
41509,5270311,21-06-2013,4302284,Lourdes,"Peter is very friendly and makes you feel right at home. The flat is in an excellent location, 5min from turn ham green tube and lots of bars, restaurant and shops. Chips wick is a very nice area. Will definitely stay again."
41509,5390661,27-06-2013,5628118,Kim,"I had one night in London before heading back to the U.S. and had neglected to book a room.  Peter responded promptly to my rather last-minute (day before) request.  Total lifesaver!  To top it off, his place is quite conveniently located ~ 4 blocks from the Tube and just off High Street (ie. ton of cute shops and great restaurants).  I asked for a recommendation on where to eat that night and rather than suggesting a few places, he literally showed me around the neighborhood and commented on various places as we passed them.  The room itself is quite comfortable and looks out on the neighbors patios; very quiet for being so close to a busy street.  He also has a nice patio which I saw but did not have time to utilize. Great experience all around."
41509,5476430,01-07-2013,7096660,Jessica,"Our stay at Peter's was wonderful! Chiswick is an amazing neighbourhood and its 150m from the tube station. The bed was the most comfortable,e bed I've slept in since I started my travels 7 months ago. Peter is super friendly and very knowledgeable about local sights and attractions. I'd definitely stay here again!"
41509,5612918,08-07-2013,2541989,Ines,"Peter was a very amicable host. Right after my arrival, he showed me around the appartment and to the local ice cream shop! <br/><br/>The appartment is in perfect distance to London (30 min. by underground) in the very nice and neat suburb of Chiswick. Excellent location for breakfast and dinners in the small cafés and pubs around. Also a very safe environment. "
41509,5818387,17-07-2013,7387004,Raquel,"Peter was a very good host, helped us with everything he could and made the stay very pleasant. He strives to communicate in other languages ​​and has a beautiful house. I recommend him."
41509,7931519,08-10-2013,3280942,Taro,"Peter's house is located at really nice area and room is quite clean and comfortable. On my first day, he guided the neighborhood for me. He is very frank and kind person and never meddle me. "
41509,8514068,03-11-2013,3814495,Gary,"My stay with Peter was extremely pleasant.  The townhouse is in a great location.  It is 5 min to the tube, which will bring you to downtown London in 10min.  The area is very pretty.  He is virtually located on chiswick high road, which is lined with great restaurants, pubs, and stores.  Everything you need is right next door. Bathroom is clean.  Shower is hot.  Peter is an accommodating, friendly and laid back host.  If you are happy and doing your own thing, he is happy.  I enjoyed my stay very much and most likely will be back."
41509,9061285,03-12-2013,2237434,Lisa,"Peter was a great host,y dad and brother stayed here on a trip to the UK. I met peter briefly my both my dad and brother said he was helpful and accommodating during their stay!  "
41509,9747937,07-01-2014,2209311,Carol,"My partner and I had a wonderful time staying in Peter's beautiful Chiswick home for a week when we first arrived in the UK. It was in the most perfect location in West London, with busses and trains constantly giving us access to the city within a matter of mins. The room is large and we were kept toasty-warm on those cold London nights! We were looked after beautifully by Maria and we often bump into her in Chiswick :) Thank you again for sharing your home with us at such short notice and hopefully see you soon! :)"
41509,11112470,21-03-2014,12448872,Nicolas,"Short but nice stay in the Peter's house. <br/>You can actually meet and discuss with him, not like in ghost-hosted bnb we can find online. <br/>And the place is well located at few minutes to Turnam Green underground station ! "
41509,12766084,10-05-2014,2034291,Colin,"Peter is a friendly and helpful host and over my extended time there, we were closer to flatmates than guest/host I think!:-). The area has a wide variety of restaurants and shops, and is very handy to transport. I am the second of my family to stay at Peter's. At this rate he will evntually get to meet us all! Cheers! Colin "
41509,12850900,12-05-2014,14713805,Sarah,"Peter’s place is in a super location, it’s well connected to Heathrow and Central London by Tube and it’s near all the shops and amenities of the Chiswick High Road. He is a very warm and welcoming host. <br/>The room is a good size for two people, however one issue is that it has old-style sash windows which have come loose in the frame so there is a constant draft of wind which moves the blind. On the weekend we stayed it was quite windy so the window and blind rattled constantly throughout the night making it quite difficult to sleep. <br/>"
41509,19758274,17-09-2014,20288153,Carolyn,A great spot for my 3 nights in London.  I made a last minute booking and was very happy with my stay with Peter.   It was simple to get around by tube or bus (close walk to Turnham Green) both into London and also back to Heathrow.  Peter gave me tips on places to see and eat near his home.   (I really enjoyed wandering the gardens at Chiswick House).  Peter was a friendly and generous host.     I slept well in the comfy bed -  not a lot of extra space in the room but more than sufficient for me.   Good lighting - easy to access outlets - and plenty of hot tea.
41509,19810410,18-09-2014,21396059,Sandy,"Peter was very welcoming and my mother felt at ease. <br/>The room was clean and exactly like the pictures.<br/>Chiswick is a great place to stay, full of lovely restaurants and shops.<br/>My mother really enjoyed her stay at Peter's place."
41509,20219382,25-09-2014,10725071,Kirsty,"Peter was a good host, he couldn't have been friendlier and I felt very safe (staying there on my own), Peter had bought breakfast things and set the table for me, very sweet.<br/>The bedroom was comfortable, I slept really well in the bed and it was a nice room. <br/>The location was fabulous, right off the High Street in central Chiswick, near all the great shops and bars.<br/>I thought the cost was quite high all things considered as the cost is £60 but with the cleaning cost and AirBNB fee added it is total of £92 which is really quite steep.<br/><br/>"
41509,22191754,01-11-2014,10228993,Malachy,"I had a wonderful and pleasant stay in this room. Peter is welcoming and courteous. The room is along the hall from the bathroom which was very convenient and I had use of the living room dining and kitchen. The flat is in an excellent location for Chiswick and London connections.<br/><br/>I would happily book to stay here again."
41509,22592620,10-11-2014,22110419,Frederique,"I was happy when I booked a room in Peter's apartment. The house was located in Chiswick, well located in a nice area and the room seemed correct. But, I was disappointed and I will try to explain why.<br/><br/>-  The welcome was warm but when we arrived the apartment was cold. We managed to restart the central heating boiler and then we realized that radiators did not work in the bathroom and the room. In addition, the apartment is difficult to heat because there is no double glazing. We also had cold at night because there was only a thin blanket on the bed without additional coverage.<br/>- Peter was not in London. He left us a note with the password to access the WiFi. But I could not read his writing hand and he did not respond to my requests verification mode switches message. <br/>- The apartment was cluttered with a lot of old items messy that attract dust.<br/>- The walls were recently repainted but stained tiles in the kitchen and bathroom would really need to be changed.<br/><br/>Overall, the price is a professional price but not the service.<br/>"
41509,23019007,20-11-2014,23478392,Anna,The host was very nice and helpful and we would  definitely stay there again. Thank you very much. 
41509,39292946,22-07-2015,35145623,Fredy,Peter was welcoming and gave us a few ideas for exploring London. We had a good night's sleep for each of the three nights we stayed.

41509,47878994,21-09-2015,43286736,Kim,Peter was waiting up late for us to arrive since out flight to London was late. <br/>We stayed on our own floor and had our separate bathroom. He has a lot of stuff in his room but is was clean and all of us had 3 nights good sleep.<br/>Peter is a very friendly and open  person. He gave us good guidance to attractions we didn't know of. <br/>There is very good restaurants near  turnham green for half price of centrum.

Il nous a donné plein de renseignements que ce qu'il y avait à faire dans les environs. La maison correspondait exactement aux photos (avec un peu plus de désordre : ) - charmant désordre  d'ailleurs, que nous avons aprécié aussi).<br/>Maison très propre et confortable, belle salle de bain et lits douillets...super bien située à 5 mn à pieds du métro Turnham Green et à coté de Chiswick High Street qui vaut vraiment le coup (magasins, PUB, restos, parcs), nous l'avons arpentée avec bonheur  pendant  plusieurs heures! Peter avait prévu un adaptateur de prise de courant, c'est sympa ça! et il nous a laissé un petit mot dimanche matin pour nous rappeler le changement d'heure! merci Peter!"
41509,52555482,30-10-2015,46913552,David,"Peter was  welcoming and went over the apartmet and where things were etc. The location is very good. The apartment is right in the heart of Chiswick and very close to the underground station and the numerous restaurants and bars. The rooms may ahve changed around since the photos. However, the room I used was freshly made up and suited my requirements. I would definately look at usinng Peter's apartment again. "

We had breakfast together and chatted with him which was lovely. He gave us a box of chocolates which was quite thoughtful of him.

41509,74808629,16-05-2016,7096660,Jessica,"I've stayed with Peter before and I look forward to staying with him again!  He is so lovely and very helpful overall, but especially with knowing events and directions.  The house is bright & airy, the bedroom & bathroom are very spacious, and the street outside is quiet at night.  I honestly slept better at Peter's house than I normally do in my own bed.  The house is about a 2 minute walk from Turnham Green tube station, so very convenient, and the surrounding shops, restaurants, and parks make for a friendly and relaxed neighbourhood vibe.  I will definitely be back!  :)"
41509,76145048,25-05-2016,66994876,L,"Peter was super helpful and hospitable before we checked in. I needed a babysitter at a short notice.

41509,83678824,03-07-2016,34221520,Mantas,"My two week stay at Peter's place was great. Peter is very welcoming, a good company for a conversation and very knowledgeable of the local area. He was flexible to accommodate different numbers of people over the booking period and allowed to use the kitchen and laundry facilities. The property is right next to the high street, so all the shops and restaurants are 60 seconds away.<br/><br/>It is Peter's home, so there are books and personal items everywhere - I find this as part of a charm of Airbnb rather than a hotel room, but do have this in mind if you are looking for a blank space / empty room."
41509,84866739,09-07-2016,7488497,Netta,"Peter is a highly cultured and educated man. He is an easy-going host and interesting to talk to. I felt welcome, safe, and comfortable at his house. "

41509,149030935,02-05-2017,53183423,Sadhbh,"Lovely room with loads of interesting books everywhere! Both the bedroom and the bathroom were spacious and clean. The house itself has good vibes (I had a pleasant feeling right away) and is conveniently located in the heart of beautiful Chiswick, just off Chiswick High Road and only 3 minutes walk from Turnham Green station on the District line. Not far from Chiswick House and Gardens, Kew or Richmond park either. As usual, West London is quite simply fantastic! Peter is a really friendly polyglot, who is laid-back, particularly cultured and seems to be interested in and open-minded about a lot of things. I could only recommend his place, it was grand altogether!"
41509,152131574,15-05-2017,7096660,Jessica,"It's always a pleasure staying at Peter's place-- it's the reason I stay at his home every time I come to London!  His home is spacious and airy and very comfortable, and he's always good for a chat & a laugh or neighborhood restaurant/activity recommendations.  It's a 2 min walk to the tube station and only a few short tube stops to central London.  The neighborhood is beautiful and his street is quiet for a peaceful sleep, despite being only steps to the high street.  I'll keep coming back for sure!  :)"

41509,172982209,22-07-2017,26704462,Jenny,This was perfect for us because we were visiting our daughter who lived in the next street. So close to the tube and excellent restaurants too. Peter was very obliging and friendly. Only one flight up to take bags for long-haul travellers. The room was a little overcrowded and while you could have three people in the room (even four with the fold away bed) you would be falling over each other and your luggage if you did that.

41509,336386479,14-10-2018,49233233,Jason,"Peter is the most gracious host, who will go the extra mile to make sure you enjoy london. The room was cozy and warm, and a great base to explore london from."
41509,343941883,02-11-2018,3397255,Antonio,I had a good time at Peter's house. I stayed 3 weeks. The room was welcoming and private.
41509,353959493,30-11-2018,7178411,Katerina,"Great host and great experience, I really enjoyed my stay!! Very highly recommended!"
41509,420009373,05-03-2019,170155139,Hilary,"Up one flight of stairs, a lovely bright and very large bedroom and our own bathroom.  Friendly and polite very knowledgeable of the area. 5 mins walk to Turnham Green tube station and a short walk to Chiswick High Road."
41509,427777955,24-03-2019,7178411,Katerina,"Second time I stayed at Peter's and everything was excellent, like my first stay! The room is great, the location is amazing and very close to shops, transport and local amenities and Peter is a lovely host! Very highly recommended and will be returning soon!"
41509,498708905,30-07-2019,273677282,Jagdish,Peter is a very helpful and polite host. The place is very well kept and clean and altogether I would unhesitatingly recommend it as a place to stay. This was the first time we did Airbnb and I have to say I would very happily do it again especially at Peter's place.
41509,512134710,18-08-2019,241509200,Chris,"Peter's place is perfect for those visiting London that don't want to spend an arm and a leg on accommodations but still receive great value.  Peter was a great host - very accommodating and helpful with local tips.  The location is within walking distance of the Turnham Green underground station which provides quick and easy access to central London, and the Chiswick has everything you need without the crowds of central London."
41509,557475382,01-11-2019,73699633,Jingwen,"Peter is a lovely host, personable, knowledgeable, funny, easygoing - an absolute delight to be around with. His place is the most unique one I’ve ever stayed at in my Airbnb experience - with lots of books, arts, and a sense of place. I would definitely choose to stay at Peter’s shall the need arises in the future."
41509,580738444,23-12-2019,306807748,Chueh-Yu,"Enjoyable stay, great host, room was clean, nice and warm. Location is awesome, not too far away from the city centre, and doesn’t take long to get to the airport, also very close to the tube station, which is awesome!"
41712,184462,19-02-2011,273563,Ina,"Nino's apartment is very nice, clutter-free and the location is great.  I would recommend renting the entire apartment for more privacy. "
41712,206804,22-03-2011,64929,Kate,"Nino's place was lovely - just as pictured, clean, with great natural light and views to the London Eye and the Shard, and super comfortable bed! Excellent location, easy walk from the Underground and to Borough Market, Tate, Waterloo lots of independent galleries and the river Embankment walks. I rented the whole apt for one night and just the room the other two nights -all worked out very well, and no hitches.  Added bonus was getting to know Nino, a fascinating and wonderful person, and a great host. A few flights of stairs to reach the flat, so don't bring lots of heavy luggage, but then again it's a great way to burn off the fish and chips and other local treats ; D<br/><br/>Would be happy to go back or host her in New York anytime. "
41712,221590,09-04-2011,449572,Ana,"I really enjoyed the time I spent with Nino in her apartment. The 4th floor location made for excellent views (including of the London Eye). There are lots of stairs to climb but this wasn't a problem for me and it fits with the healthy theme of the apartment. This is a relaxing, tranquil place with simple, minimal decor. Great if you want to feel restful and inspired, especially combined with the cultural and artistic amenities in the area (which Nino will direct you to). I had the privilege to share some meals with Nino and she is an excellent cook as well as wonderful company."
41712,229137,17-04-2011,69063,Candace,"Nino was the perfect host! This was my first time renting a room and I had such a great time. It was fun having her as a roomate. I would love to stay with her again. And her flat was in the PERFECT location. Next to the best coffee shop in London, 3 minutes from the tube and tons of art galleries."
41712,259840,11-05-2011,524163,Nicolas,"Nino was a really great host. She is really friendly and recommended to us a lot of things to do and see.<br/>Regarding the appartment, that was perfect : clean and perfect location as it is closed to all London main spots.<br/>It was pleasure to go there. Thanks again and maybe see you next time :)"
41712,266511,16-05-2011,556336,Claire,"We had a wonderful time at Nino's! Her place is lovely, very quiet and perfectly located close to the Modern Tate.<br/>Nino is a lovely person and she gave us really useful advice for our time in London. We also enjoyed nice chat with her... and tasted her delicious meal.<br/>We'll definitely recommend staying at her place and we will when we come back to London!"
41712,272740,20-05-2011,593783,Rachel,"What a great flat to stay in!   Nino was the perfect host - kind, respectful and good company.  Her place is clean, has a peaceful environment and perfectly located in a great part of London with a short walk to Tate and great restaurants and cafes nearby.   The recommendations she shared were all fantastic!   Her description lines up perfectly, and I love how she noted about the interests- because it attracted me to her listing - and in turn, was the perfect fit!  I'd recommend Nino's flat to everyone!  Oh, and the view is a delightful surprise! "
41712,283905,27-05-2011,449572,Ana,"As always, this is a great haven at the end of a long day out and about in London."
41712,300017,06-06-2011,500852,Arjun,"I was with Nino for only one week, but it was splendid. The space was well designed, I loved the view, and her company. We got along very well, chatted about everything from music, to philosophy & life. While it was a bit of a challenge to get all of my photo equipment up the 5 story staircase, it was well worth it for the view of the London Eye.  "
41712,331827,24-06-2011,431788,D-Mo,"NINO is a very honest and genuine lady.Very friendly and special host.<br/>Comfortable apartment with nice layout.<br/>Great location!<br/>"
41712,337715,27-06-2011,650234,Tom,"The apartment was immaculate, modern, and comfortable. Nino is a helpful hostess, and the neighborhood is great. My only complaint about the place is the 5 flight hike up the stairs, which can be a bit cumbersome when you're carrying luggage for a 3 week vacation. But apart from that, this is a wonderful base for a visit to London."
41712,349894,03-07-2011,689110,Kimberly,"Nino's place is in a great location just a short walk to the Old Vic, the Globe, the Thames and the National Theater. And a walk across the bridge will get you over to Covent Gardens and into heart of the theater district. Nino's place itself is a bit bare bones, even austere, and there is heavy, loud construction going on that starts at 8 a.m. on a project that looks like it will be going for quite some time. I tended to stay up late and get up a bit later since I was coming from the U.S. and my internal clock was still 6 hours ahead of London time. The banging and jack hammer were a bit hard to take on so little sleep. There is only a clothing rack (no closet) with only 3 hangars and no dresser or table stand in the bedroom. The pillow is quite flat without much support, but the bed is very comfortable and there is a reading lamp on each side of the bed. The internet service worked well, but there isn't a living room or other sitting room, although there is a table and chair in the kitchen area.  I asked for very little and was gone almost as soon as I got up and didn't get back until late. And yet, Nino seemed very put out just to have me there. I think she is burned out on company and just needs the money. She complained about previous guests from the moment I met her. I felt like an intruder rather than a welcomed guest. To her credit, however, Nino helped carry my bags up the 6 flights of steps, and, I think in an attempt to get a good review, loaned me her membership card to the Tate Modern."
41712,381121,18-07-2011,415561,Nicolas,"Nino's apartment was a nice and simple base for my short trip to London. The location is excellent for the tube, culture, and trendy spots nearby. The area nearby is currently undergoing some construction, but isn't a problem if you're out exploring during the day. Finally, Nino is a pleasure to get along with and very respectful."
41712,395771,25-07-2011,419933,Dirk-Michael,"Great Location  and a very friendly host. There is no lift, elevator and it is quite a couple stairs up. The place is very clean and tidy. There is not much privacy because the host lives in the same apartment and the place all together is very small which is probably normal in London. There could be a cubit in the room to store the clothes etc. because a clothes rack with three hangers is probably not enough for most travellers. In my opinion the place is a little bit too expensive for what is offered but I had a great time there and enjoyed London."
41712,460605,20-08-2011,735870,Gesine+Gerry,"Had a great stay with Nino and a deep sleep in the bedroom. The flat is really close to the Tate Modern and tube and cool restaurants and cafes around, great place to explore London from. "
41712,503854,05-09-2011,438905,Wolfgang,"Next to Tate Modern it's a perfect homebase for exploring the city. Nino is easy going and absolutly honest. The place/room is clean and has a great view. The bed is more than comfortable. All in all, a perfect place to stay in the center of London!"
41712,531226,14-09-2011,979464,Lindsay,"Nino is a warm, genuine, and intelligent person who is sincerely interested in getting to know her guests. She welcomed me into her home with an offer of tea and a conversation, and I felt relaxed and refreshed after a tiring trip. The flat itself is absolutely beautiful; it was a pleasure to stay in such a peaceful and well-thought-out space. The neighbourhood is also great, with plenty to see and do. If you get the opportunity, do book some time at Nino's!"
41712,564027,24-09-2011,457036,Sebastian,"Nino was a friendly and flexible host. I had to change the arrival time several times and Nino was always available by phone to answer my questions. Also we had some interesting conversations and of course a cup of tea :)<br/><br/>The flat is lockated central and close to the subway, so everything is good to reach. Everything was clean and and also the guest room was clean and comfortable. <br/><br/>This was my first time with airbnb and i had very nice stay. For sure i will try again."
41712,587948,01-10-2011,1024558,Laura,"Nino was a great host, accepting my reservation on very short notice as my travel plans had changed.  The location is fantastic, very close to the Tate Modern and Burough Market."
41712,620759,11-10-2011,891422,Sayaka,"My husband and I stayed with Nino for 3 nights. Nino was a great host, she was very accommodating and we had interesting conversation over tea and chocolate when we checked in. She also happened to have some free time on our second morning and was kind enough to take us to the Borough Market. The walls were thin so it got a bit noisy at times, but it seems like that's just London. The bed was very comfortable and the room nice and clean. Nino was friendly without being intrusive in any way. "
41712,669737,27-10-2011,527382,Mathias,"I really liked the chats that I had with Nino and would come back anytime. Even so that our talks mainly happened late at night, after a whole day working, there was never an uncomfortable moment. Both of us talked about our AirBnB experiences and how we ended up doing it, and about million other things. I have to say that I really appreciated her being there and I had the feeling that she also didn't mind. One thing that I especially liked was her lifestyle. I hope next time I do get some Yoga lessons included ;-) "
41712,711282,12-11-2011,198144,Anna,"Nettes Apartment, gute Lage. Leider gab mir die Gastgeberin zu verstehen, dass sie es bevorzugt, wenn ich nicht all zu viel Zeit in Ihrer Wohnung verbringe.. Sonst ganz nett."
41712,729974,19-11-2011,300497,David,"My wife and I stayed at Nino's flat for six nights in November for our first airbnb experience. The flat is in a perfect location for us in an area of London that we know really well. It's a beautiful flat and Nino is a warm and friendly host. Nino was very clear at the time of the booking that the bathroom might get crowded in the mornings with three people, but as we were using a gym around the corner nearly every day we didn't use the bathroom much anyway. The room is a good size and the futon bed was very comfortable, actually larger than the picture suggested."
41712,757731,01-12-2011,1301059,Masumi,"I loved staying at Nino's place. She is a warm-hearted, very kind person and we had so much in common that I couldn't expect better than that for my 2 nights stay. Southwalk area is rather quiet, architecturally interesting area and as I'm Art lover, 10 min. walk from Tate Modern was just perfect. <br/>Whenever I come back to London, I have no doubt checking her place's availability first !  Apartment is very clean, simply decorated with a good taste and I love wooden floor. I normally don't sleep well if it is not my own bed but I slept like an angel at her place ;-) So anyone wish to have no hectic, quiet space in London, her place is ideal!"
41712,902187,05-02-2012,915977,Altea,"Nino is a great woman. She was very kind to me and helped whenever I needed anything. The apartment is very well located, beautifully decorated and comfortable. I recommend it."
41712,1210556,01-05-2012,1956070,Massimo,"It was a lovely weekend the one spent at Nino's home. Her place is nice and quite central and she is a wonderful and discrete host. She's also been very kind and suggested a restaurant nearby where we had a very good dinner. Highly raccomended, both Nino and her apartment (and the restaurant)."
41712,1250422,08-05-2012,153852,Amiel,"Nino was great, greeting me like an old friend. The flat was minimalist and lovely. "
41712,1322873,21-05-2012,2340029,Cole,"Nino was a gracious hostess and the flat was bright, airy, clean, and well located for exploring central London.  My wife and I stayed for 2 nights and it was a great experience."
41712,2159514,01-09-2012,2800276,Anne,"I enjoyed my stay at Nino's.  Her apartment is clean and bright and comfortable.  The only note I would make is that it is on the fourth floor and there is no elevator so people who travel with heavy luggage or who have mobility issues should be aware of this.  Other than that, a great location with easy access to three Tube stations."
41712,2285730,14-09-2012,1727899,Braden And Brian,Nino was an excellent host with a centrally-located zen apartment.  We had great conversation and she is very sweet.  I highly recommend staying here.
41712,2500686,03-10-2012,2940229,Mahmoud,"Nino flat was simple, nice,  clean and comfortable . Additionally , she was so helpful during my stay. the location is perfect , area is 100% safe specially if you came late at night ,  you can see London Eye from her flat and it's  less than 5 min walking to Southwark station .  I highly recommend to stay with her specially SOLO/Female traveler.  "
41712,2591374,12-10-2012,3524962,Jack,"Nino was a fabulous host, warm and funny. Her apartment was simply furnished, and a quick walk to Waterloo, and the brilliant Anchor and Hope pub. In short the perfect place to return to after dashing around London. Thanks Nino!"
41712,2755676,29-10-2012,3930023,Brittany,"This was my first time using AirBnB and I can't say enough great things about Nino and her place. Nino was incredibly welcoming; she made us feel right at home and was happy to tell us all about the city. Her apartment was absolutely beautiful. It was exactly as pictured and flawlessly clean. I believe someone else mentioned this earlier, but the bed in her photos is also a bit larger than it seems in the picture provided, so no need to worry about having enough room. My friend and I slept very comfortably both nights. I definitely give stars in every category! I highly recommend it. Thanks, Nino!"
41712,2851056,10-11-2012,3828348,Alexandra,"Nino's place is cute and very tidy. Simple decoration but everything you need, exactly as in pictures, a very nice apartment. And Nino is a great host, helping and giving information and advice around London. Since I was traveling alone for business purposes, she was very nice sharing her dinners and time with me. It is a very good place to stay when traveling alone, just take in mind that it is a fourth floor with no elevator when packing! I would stay there again!"
41712,3053021,09-12-2012,3421611,Jens,"Nino is really gracious host and her apartment is lovely (and lovely minimalist). And you also get a bit of exercise for free climbing to the fourth floor.<br/>Her place is ideal if you want to explore the Southbank area by foot - lots to see, lots to taste. You also can get on the tube and go everywhere in London.<br/>I definitely recommend Nino and her place and would stay there again without hesitation."
41712,4255561,22-04-2013,2210799,Cécile,"Nino's place is just great: easily accessible with public transportation (5 minutes walk from Southwark station) and within walkable distance of the Thames and the Tate Modern, it is welcoming, tidy, clean, quiet .... in short very comfortable! And Nino is a great hostess, communicative, flexible and looking forward to share her tips to make your stay something to remember. Thank you Nino!"
41712,4319387,27-04-2013,3718463,Neil,"I needed a room while working for a few days in London, just south of the river.  Nina was able to make arrangements to put me up with very short notice.<br/><br/>All communications were excellent and clear meaning that, during  the day I could just get on with my work.<br/><br/>Nina's flat is lovely and clean, very comfortable.  It is up 5 or 6 flights of stairs so easy on the packing!<br/><br/>Nina herself is a most charming hostess, very polite and interesting without being overbearing.  Thank you Nina, it w as a pleasure to meet you and stay with you."
41712,4397569,02-05-2013,5993497,Rebecca,"Nino's flat is superbly clean and I was left impressed by how she keeps everything maintained to the highest standard. By far the cleanest accommodation I've stayed at in central London. Nino left me to enjoy the apartment on my own for much of the time, and in one instance graciously waited for me. "
41712,8590658,06-11-2013,9240584,Patrick,"I had a very nice time staying at Ninas place. The apartment was very clean, I like the minimalistic interior design and nearby attractions such as the Brought market and our Office ;-).<br/><br/>Nina was a very kind host.<br/>"
41712,10779975,07-03-2014,11424568,Markus,"Just what you need: a lovely bed/space in truly central area that offers some thrill close at hand. And a host that is easy, nice and very welcoming. "
41712,12503849,04-05-2014,9789039,Mimian,"This was my first time in London and I have to say it was so wonderful thanks to Nina's great hospitality and amazingly located Apartment. My room and the whole flat was impeccably clean, was able to sleep very well. Fast Wifi internet connection. Nina was wonderful, so easy going and also very helpful when I needed information. Lovely experience, if you're thinking of a centric place to stay close to Tate Modern this is a no brainer. Thank you Nina! Loved staying with you."
41712,12671805,07-05-2014,14046855,Alexa,"Nina's apartment was clean and well kept; however, it was not tranquil. Her place is located near the train tracks and I was woken up both nights by the train, extremely squeaky floor boards and banging of the cupboards.  Nina offered helpful advice to get around town. But she also barged into my room and reprimanded me for speaking too loudly at 8pm and explained the room was to be kept ""tranquil."" This is a perfect situation for someone traveling by themselves and only needs a place to lay their head. If you are traveling with anyone, or plan to be there during waking hours I would not recommend it.  "
41712,13023552,17-05-2014,11552373,Michael,"Nina is a great host and was very clear in her communications.<br/>Her apartment is very clean, comfortable and I was welcomed with a lovely cup of coffee!!! The room I had is at the back of the apartment which allows for a bit more quiet and good blacked out blinds for a decent sleep.  In addition there's and excellent view of the Shard while in the living room one of London Eye.  In terms of location, excellently situated close to Southwark station and the Jubilee Line for those coming from City airport."
41712,13571354,31-05-2014,3634281,Stacy-Marie,"Wonderful location in the city of London, with excellent views. Apartment is minimalist and full of light. Would stay here again. (A note if you have lots of bags and/or small children - there's no lift and quite a few steps to climb). "
41712,20269810,26-09-2014,16657725,Chris,"Great location for Central London or the City, and Nina was a lovely host, flexible and very fast to respond to my last minute requests. The flat is clean and uncluttered, with lots of day light and a nice view of the Shard at sunrise. "
41712,21487134,18-10-2014,15365189,Wilhelm,"Nina was a great host to me. Her room is at the 5th floor and has a beautiful view. Everything is very clean and kept in a very simple way, which I enjoyed a lot. The flat is located very central, just behind Tate Modern (higly recommended) and River Thames with all its sourroundings. <br/>Nina is a very nice, straightforward and non intrusive person. <br/>So, that´s a straight Fiver for Nina :-) "

41712,70064358,15-04-2016,4594564,Jan Dimitri,Nina made me fell very welcome! The apartment is very lovely and the neighborhood is lively and nice! :) I could walk to work and enjoyed the area big times!
41712,75233297,20-05-2016,60399991,Ian,Nina went out of her way to make me welcome. She was communicative and her home was as described and illustrated. I had a very comfortable stay. 
41712,78727266,08-06-2016,15024990,Margaux,"J'ai passé un séjour agréable chez Nina qui a un appartement très bien situé à quelques pas de la station Southwark et proches de petits commerces. Il y a tout le nécessaire au alentour pour prendre un repas, boire un verre ou partir découvrir la ville. Son quartier est très ""safe"", tout comme l'appartement de Nina qui est aussi incroyablement propre et bien rangé.<br/>Nina est une femme très instruite qui prendra plaisir à discuter avec vous sans jamais se montrer intrusive.<br/>Je recommande de séjourner chez Nina si comme moi, après des journées bien chargées vous cherchez un endroit calme où vous reposer.<br/>PS: Nina comprend et parle un peu le français, ce qui peut s'avérer pratique quand on perd ses mots."
41712,81348160,22-06-2016,43879727,Dai,Nina made me feel very welcome in her very clean flat and there was everything that I needed there.  I would definitely recommend it and stay again.

41712,105612849,02-10-2016,45242822,Sara,"Nina is lovely to talk to, very cultured and sensitive. The apartment is exactly as the pictures show: clean, classy, minimum furniture. Great location. The stairs pose a bit of a problem for those with big suitcases, but otherwise a great experience. "
41712,114295269,17-11-2016,10229277,Jamie,Neat and tidy as described. Nina was friendly and accommodating. 
41712,117317327,06-12-2016,6885682,Joseph,"Nina's cozy apartment was in a great location and Nina herself was an absolute delight. She was very friendly and helpful as well as respectful, considerate, and accommodating. The flat has beautiful wood floors and stunning views of the Southwark neighborhood. It was an absolute pleasure to stay here!"
41712,120170688,08-12-2016,6912614,Eva,"Perfect place to stay: central<br/>location, room is clear, white, very clean, you can breathe some calm here after busy day in the city. Nina was really kind, and open. I enjoyed our little chat.  Thanks, Nina it was a pleasure to meet you."
41712,134206985,26-02-2017,62024204,Suki,"Nina is a great host, who provided easy communication, clear guidance&rules and warm welcome to the guest. I enjoyed my stay at hers! Very lovely living&stylish room and dining area and clean&simple bedroom, which are exactly like described. The most important is it's convenient location- 10 min walk to the TATE modern and other attractions, saving you lots of time on transportation.<br/>Thanks Nina for being a good host, I enjoyed chatting with you with hot tea and chocolate, hope you felt the same. "
41712,148339175,30-04-2017,126613276,Ken,"Nina was a very kind host and made me feel welcome. The flat is simple, but the rooms were clean, the bed was very comfortable. Location was convenient-only a short walk to the South Bank, and near a tube stop."
41712,151908873,14-05-2017,126647873,Josh,"A wonderful central location, close to local shops and cafes. Nina is a very welcoming host who gave me my own space but was also available when I needed her. The flat had everything that I needed and it was a pleasure to stay. The only negative (which is beyond Nina's control) is the lack of a lift, and being a 6th floor flat this is something to consider. That said, the views of the shard from the bedroom are worth the climb."
41712,155682234,28-05-2017,103340095,Sonia,"Nina is a great, nice communicated host, and I would like to show my appreciation towards her for family liked care during my internship in London. The softy bed and bright living room are perfect, the rooms are clean, simple, and beautiful. The location is well to go to everywhere in London, it takes 9 mins to Piccadilly circles and 15 mins to Euston from Southwark station. I spent lovely 8 days with Nina, her kindness for each guests, and she is passionate about making comfortable space for them. Best choice for the traveling or business in there."
41712,164988061,30-06-2017,59613516,Tobias,"Nina is just the perfect AirBnB host - lovely, friendly, a good conversationalist. Her place is comfortable, quiet and very central. I really enjoyed my stay and will definitely come back some day."
41712,203548483,15-10-2017,4955906,Jane,"You can't do better than staying Nina's light-filled apartment with wonderful views overlooking London.  Nina is a welcoming and gracious host, willing to meet every need.  It's a small apartment, best for those who have business in town or are arts/theater tourists and apt to be out most of the day.  Not to say, you are not welcome to return to the apartment for rests between activities.  The location is perfect -- easy to get to from Heathrow by tube and for access to the Tate Modern, the Globe, the National Theater and the West End's theaters and museums.  There is access to several tube lines in nearby stations and of course there is the Thames minutes away for long calming walks.   Thank you, Nina!"

41712,578285126,17-12-2019,20955931,Yongshao,"Unbeatable location for accessing all of central London - a surprising number of trips into the city one can simply manage on foot - not to mention the bustling bar/restaurant/theatre scene right outside the residential unit. Quite a minimalist room in itself that nevertheless enjoys a stunning view - and relative quietude considering its location - not so much common space other than a shared bathroom and hallway. An ideal lodging for those who will be out in the city a lot and don't require a ton of amenities.<br/>Nina is a straight-forward, no-nonsense host who treats her boundaries with the guests very seriously - as she uses the flat a lot for her own work/practice. But if there ever was time for a chat she can be brilliant, compassionate, and candid about many facets of living inside this world metropolis."
41712,4.69348E+17,09-10-2021,127384125,Estelle,"Nina’s place was great, the location was really convenient for me. Everything was as described, and Nina was a wonderful host!"

41712,5.00562E+17,21-11-2021,420824124,Geeta,"Neat and clean room. Minimally furnished with a bed, clothes hanger, a small table (size of a side table), a chair and a long mirror on the floor. Anything else required (such as coffee maker, hair dryer, iron board etc.) can be requested as needed from the host. Great view from the bedroom and the apartment. Approx 80 stairs to climb."
41712,5.78092E+17,08-03-2022,275927248,Jacqueline,Nina is a great host and her home is beautiful. I really enjoyed my stay here and I will miss our chats over a cup of tea in the mornings. <br/>This place is in a great central location and I would recommend walking to the market on Sunday mornings.
41712,5.81057E+17,12-03-2022,22272841,Glendon,"Nina's place is in a great location for exploring London. For me, it was really close to my office so was awesome for for the week of work!<br/>The room has all you need, bed and clothes rack, so is perfect if you plan on being out exploring or like me, in an office.<br/>Sadly I became ill during my stay which made me a bit homesick. Nina kindly made me some ginger tea and let me sit on her balcony which helped a lot.<br/>Nina and I found similar interests in yoga so had some interesting discussions. Thank you."
41712,5.87506E+17,21-03-2022,437981403,Fangling,Nina is very nice and friendly. The room is clean and minimise the furniture. The whole flat is clean and great location. It was a lovely stay.

41712,5.9908E+17,06-04-2022,6169870,Bora,"I had a lovely stay at Nina's very clean and conveniently located apartment. The room she prepares for guests is just what you need: very firm and comfortable bed, a clothes rack to hang your clothes, a small drawer and side table to store your items, and a great view of the Shard from the window! <br/>Nina was very attentive and was concerned about scaffolding that had come up over the weekend before I checked in for some outside work. There might have been drilling once or twice in the morning hours, but I was not disturbed by this at all as I spent most days out of the apartment for meetings or working remotely from cafes nearby.  <br/>All in all, Nina is a very attentive and caring host."
41712,6.02041E+17,10-04-2022,45296253,Eduardo,"The location and view is great, you'll see the shard from the room and the eye from the kitchen. The apartment is clean and have all essentials for a short stay. Matress and pillows were fantastic and I slept well after dyas of walking the beautiful London. Plenty of restaurants and cafés around the building. Nina is a welcoming person and a great host who will not invade your privacy. Only advice for people with mobility problems is that this is a 4th floor with no elevator in the building, but other than that I recommend it."
41712,6.15015E+17,28-04-2022,91685102,Simon,"Good location and clean conditions.<br/>Nina was sociable, accommodating and friendly. Suited me for my work trip perfectly."

41712,6.30269E+17,19-05-2022,7306486,Soo Young,"I loved the location! You can just walk to Tate Modern, London Bridge, Westminster and so on.. also it’s 5 min walk to the Southwark station. You can even see London Eye from the flat. There is no elevator in the bldg. Currently there is some scaffolding going on in the bldg, but it did not bother me at all. Nina made me feel very comfortable to stay with. It was a pleasure to meet and talk to her. If I come to London I will definitely come back here!"

41712,6.52002E+17,18-06-2022,10527554,Suzana,"I really enjoyed my stay in Nina's lovely home, which is peaceful and airy and tastefully decorated. The flat is very conveniently located, less than five minute walk to Southwark tube station and Tate Modern, and very close to many other attractions on the Southbank. Nina is a very friendly host and a very interesting person to talk to, which always makes airbnb stays all the more enjoyable. Highly recommended -- thanks again for having me, Nina!"

41712,6.781E+17,24-07-2022,3603159,Carlos,"Writing an honest review: as positives, the location is great, the shower has good pressure which is a good positive for me and Nina has been very respectful and attentive to me throughout the stay.<br/>Unfortunately, the building is undergoing cladding replacement work, which means there is scaffolding with a translucent screen covering the view, and workers on weekdays between 8-5pm. Tbh this wasn’t a major issue for me, however possibly given that the old cladding is gone in the building the room is more sensitive to temperature extremes, and was too hot for a comfortable sleep in 2 of the 3 days I stayed in. In less sunny weather, this would have been a pretty decent stay."

I was a little unsure about the idea but the stay went pretty well. <br/>She updated me about the  good shopping places around and even with some ongoing offers and discounts at stores. <br/>Overall a nice experience.
41712,9.95572E+17,05-10-2023,28695377,Joshua,Loved staying at Nina’s place. She is very friendly and makes you feel at home. Very kind making me tea on a late arrival and letting me drop my case early. Very comfortable and clean room. Would definitely stay again!

Bimpe and family were  great hosts, and happily put up with my insane work schedule (leave early return late, etc). The walk to the tube was around 10-15 minutes, I didn't take the bus so I'm unsure how long that would take. Would definitely stay here again if I'm in London"

42010,106862,27-09-2010,209318,Frank,"Our stay with Agri and Roger was a high point of our twelve days in London.  The Fords are a live, outgoing and interesting couple.  Agri spoiled us daily with home baked scones and many choices such as fresh fruit and yogurt for breakfast. <br/><br/>The setting is quiet and convenient, about a five minute walk from the East Finchley Tube station.  The back yard is an oasis of beautiful plantings and flowers.<br/><br/>The days at Blenheim House were a cultural experience in themselves.  In addition to us North Americans we interacted with South Americans, Asians and Europeans. One day we were treated to an impromptu harp concet and on another evening we walked into a rousing group of fans watching a championship soccer (football) game.<br/><br/>Any return visit to London will certainly include time with Agri and Roger."
42010,116179,11-10-2010,234256,Milen,"My girlfriend and I stayed with at Agri and Roger's house for almost two weeks and I can honestly declare that each day was wonderful. Our hosts were extremely kind and always there to help if needed. The double room that we stayed in was quite spacious and very clean (this holds true for the whole house). The wi-fi connection was good.<br/>Every morning we were offered a rich breakfast (Agri tried to satisfy the preferences her guests as much as possible). The breakfast was a pleasurable experience not only because of the delicious food but also because of the lovely view towards the garden (a true masterpiece in my opinion!). Also, there are two lovely cats in the house which are absolutely adorable and contribute to the cozy atmosphere. We highly recommend everyone who is looking for a place to stay in London to choose this house!"
42010,120855,17-10-2010,253067,Patricia,Agri is a wonderful host.  She was extremely helpful and helped us get around.
42010,122792,19-10-2010,207192,Robert,"A great location about half an hour to forty minutes from the centre of London by tube. Excellent host, very welcoming and open. The room was large and clean. Would definitely stay there again. "
42010,125988,24-10-2010,260494,Jeff,"I had a wonderful stay with Roger and Agri at their lodge.  First of all, their communication was very good.  They had given me easy directions to the lodge from the Underground and had even offered to pick me up.  I decided to walk since the lodge was so close.   Roger and Agri are a very nice couple.  They made sure that I felt safe and comfortable during my stay in London.  They also offer their help to guide one around London if necessary.   Agri's sister, who happened to be helping out when Agri was away, was very nice as well.  Breakfast was served in the dining room, where you could see out into a beautiful large garden area.  Make sure to step outside and view it even if it is cold outside.<br/><br/>I stayed five nights in two different rooms.  The first was comfortable and there was sink in the room which made it easy to brush my teeth without leaving the room.  There is a desk, television, lockable storage, closet and a bed for two.  <br/><br/>The second room, which I'm guessing is the suite, has the same amenities as the first room, plus a sofa (big enough to sleep on), a separate kitchen (that includes a washing machine for clothes) and a television with premium channels.<br/><br/>Both rooms are very warm, so there is no need to bundle up.  The toilets, showers and bath are shared facilities, but they're very clean.<br/><br/>I would stay with Roger and Agri the next time I am in London and would recommend that you do the same.<br/><br/>Note:  Agri was away on holiday for most of my stay, but she was nice enough to go out of her way to say hello when she got back.  They are very nice people.  Treat them well."

42010,140156,16-11-2010,268202,Zeny,"I can see why Agri & Roger consistently receive great reviews.  I stayed at their adorable house with my boyfriend for 9 nights and had an absolutely amazing, stress-free experience.  Their house is conveniently located near the East Finchley tube stop on the Northern Line which takes you everywhere--Camden Town, Old Street, Leicester Square, etc.  I would often head back to their place midday to take a quick break or rest and would look forward to doing so.  They have a beautiful home, and every morning we would have breakfast overlooking their pretty yard.  If I ever return to London, I would definitely stay with Agri & Roger again!"
42010,140978,17-11-2010,283402,Meagan,"Agri and her husband were such great hosts, and their home was lovely. Their cats are the sweetest animals ever!

And there were plenty of places to eat and hangout nearby. We miss them already! Thank you Agri!"
42010,142163,21-11-2010,7752,Randy,You will not meet a nicer person in the world than Agri.  I was treated like family the moment I arrived.  Agri and her husband Roger are gracious and kind hosts who pride themselves on offering a fantastic place to reside while you visit beautiful London and its surroundings.  It will be a pleasure to stay and greet my old friends again when I am in London.
42010,144479,25-11-2010,64929,Kate,"Agri and Roger were wonderful hosts! I have been a host on AirBnB for over a year, but this was my first time as a guest - a delightful first experience and one I will definitely repeat. The Fords helped figure out logistics, directions to and from the airport, and had everything ready and extremely convenient. It's very easy to reach the Tube, about 5 mins walking from their home. The room was spacious, clean and filled with natural light and everything one could want - including maps of the city, TV, hair dryer, and setup for making tea or hot coffee. When I needed an iron one was always available. Other guests were all lovely, interesting, quiet and respectful. I can recommend Agri and Roger without hesitation! "
42010,145244,27-11-2010,151152,Richard," We had an excellent time with Agri and Roger in their wonderful home.They went above and beyond, to provide us with everything we needed.I will always have fond memories of our visit to their large home,close to central London.The underground transportation is closeby,easy to walk to it,and takes you to central London in a very short time.<br/> There are also some fantastic green parks close to the house.Perfect for walking in and seeing London from a distance.<br/> Thanks so much Agri and Roger for everything! We will be back!"
42010,154960,17-12-2010,284071,Nicolas,"I stayed there almost three weeks and I can assure people,  everything about them is true and the place is also very nice ! <br/><br/>Recommended by Nicolas de France."
42010,159502,28-12-2010,314195,Carlos,"Excellent stay, great place.<br/>Agri and Roger are very friendly and were willing to answer any questions we had.<br/>Breakfast was very good, great coffee, juice, cheese, jam and lots of pastry.<br/>We recommend Blenheim Lodge to anybody going to London.<br/><br/>Thanks Agri and Roger for your hospitality!"
42010,170842,15-01-2011,212992,Simon,"Agri and Roger went way beyond what could have expected in terms of hospitality, jumping at any chance to assist.  Their overwhelming friendliness shows they clearly enjoy hosting: watching the squirrels from the heavily-laden breakfast table whilst chatting to other guests was a real highlight of my day.<br/>The room is spacious and warm.  Just 5 minutes walk will take you to the Northern Line and on the way you'll pass the White Lion pub.  Go in once and you'll keep coming back!"
42010,171683,17-01-2011,212992,Simon,I was so comfortable here that I extended my stay when my wife came down for a visit on her birthday.  See my earlier review!
42010,172770,20-01-2011,337918,Michelle,"hands down the sweetest people you will ever meet. they are super friendly and very accommodating. almost too nice if you ask me :) my room was really big as well as my bed, i felt like a princess. i had no problems whatsoever with agri and roger. and their cats are nice too!"
42010,174714,25-01-2011,337900,Nathalie,"We had a wonderful stay with Agri and Roger who were such welcoming hosts. The house is beautiful and peaceful, with a great garden, and all the guests we met there were very nice people. Great breakfast with homemade scones and a variety of cheeses and more. A perfect location close enough to Pancras International train station, and also close to Camden. We highly recommend it!"
42010,191270,02-03-2011,212992,Simon,"More great things about this place:<br/>* Huge breakfast table with new, friendly faces all the time.<br/>* Bam-bam and Brian, the house cats.<br/>* 100 year old Phoenix cinema 10 min walk away."
42010,196794,11-03-2011,212992,Simon,"The closeness of the East Finchley tube station and White Lion gastro-pub together with the generous selection of pastries, cheeses and cereals on the breakfast table make an expanding waistline a real possiblity!<br/><br/>To help against this, I recommend brisk walks (or even runs) in the three ancient woods nearby: Cherry Tree, Queens and Highgate."
42010,199593,15-03-2011,294026,Arturo,"Agri is a wonderful host. Her place is beautiful, comfortable and clean. The rooms are just perfect in size and amenities. Breakfast is fresh, huge and delicious! The house is extremely well located in a great area of North London. I strongly recommend to book this accomodation if you are planning to visit the city. And, if it happens to be your first time (just like us), then this is the place you should book. Not only because it only takes a 3 minutes walk to get to the tube station but also because Agri can give you a couple of nice tips for the sightseeing trip. Indeed, my wife and I had a wonderful stay and we wont hesitate to book it again. "
42010,209742,27-03-2011,351444,Liz,"Our stay at Agri and Roger's was wonderful!  They were very hospitable, helpful, and friendly.  Prior to our arrival she contacted us with the ways in which we could get to her home and how much these options cost us, which we found very helpful!  When we arrived she showed us around the house and told us we were welcome to come and go as we pleased.  That was nice to hear because we didn't want to be bothersome to anyone and we were excited to explore the town.  Breakfast was always waiting in the morning and it was delicious!  There were plenty of breakfast options but I couldn't pass up the scones.  Agri and Roger would always check to make sure you had what you needed for breakfast and would answer any questions you had.  It was also great having a warm shower and internet access.  Their house is close to an underground station too, making it very easy to get around the city at less of a cost.  I loved my stay here and I would recommend staying here to anyone coming to the area!  It's also very affordable!  "
42010,210566,28-03-2011,349900,Mt,"My sister recommended Blenheim Lodge & so i went ahead with the booking of 3 rooms for my family. <br/>The other reviews don't lie...Agri & Roger are two of the most genuine people one could wish to meet. The rooms/breakfasts were prepared to perfection & these hosts really ARE prepared to go the extra mile to make their guests happy.<br/><br/>Thank You from all of us<br/>Mark."
42010,216487,04-04-2011,363814,Graham,"Can not find fault with this B&B Wonderful hosts Agri and Roger look after your every need.  The breakfast is magnificent in a lovely sunny room overlooking the back garden, a great meeting place for all the guests.  The house is a beautiful old English home with wonderful garden , even a resident squirrel. Very close to the tube line for easy travel. Many thanks for parking our large van in the front yard. This has been our first stay with Air B&B and we have had a wonderful experience. "
42010,222709,11-04-2011,391055,Marusca,"Me and my 13 years old daughter enjoyed the stay a lot.<br/>Agri and Roger are very nice, helpful,  their kindness beyond any expectations and least but not the last the breakfast was great.<br/>Bam bam a silent and joyful presence, especially for my daughter.<br/>Thank you for all. We'll be your guests once we come back to London again.<br/>Highly recommended.<br/>Marusca and Daria"
42010,227184,15-04-2011,404856,Travis,Great place to stay in London. Five minutes from the tube. The local shops are ten minutes down the road. Highly recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in London!
42010,231361,19-04-2011,369987,Simona,"What can I say about living at Agri and Roger Ford?<br/>They are wonderful hosts. They took care for every one guest in a particular way. They were also very helpful in guiding us to their place from the airport at our arriving but also in London to find different places.<br/>The breakfast was huge and was served on a wonderful terrace which has a glass wall to their superb garden. It was a charming way to get up in the morning and to start a new day, filled with a lot of energy and peace.<br/>The room we took was nice, with a large bed for two. The decorations are all about London and Great Britain and I find them lovely. We had a bathroom in common with another family but it was O.K. <br/>We highly recommend to others to visit Agri’s place and to enjoy being in London.<br/><br/>Thank you for the AIrbnb team for the wonderful job you are doing!<br/><br/>Simona Bokor and family<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>"
42010,235681,22-04-2011,79469,Craig,"This place is the best place I've stayed in London, Agri is so so warm, a natural host. Had a great welcome had a nice chat with coffee looking out over their wonderful garden. The room was great, lots of space. bed was hard to get out of in the mornings. "
42010,240508,26-04-2011,411246,Nils,"We enjoyed our Stay at Agri very much, every thing was as good as promised, from the room to the cats. It is really a perfect place to discover London and relax after it. We'll come back!"

42010,248795,02-05-2011,387151,Dimitri,"Agri is amazing host! I got everything I need and enjoyed my stay a lot. It was my first stay via airbnb and I loved it more than hotels. I felt like at home because of atmosphere and like in a hotel because of services. They did everything to ensure that stay will be appreciated: keys to the house and to the room, brochure with house rules and useful information (like internet access password, etc). Bed was good and room had everything I need and even more. If I go to London again (and I will) I will definitely choose Agri's place again."
42010,252065,05-05-2011,352253,Maritza,"Agri and Roger are wonderful hosts.  We enjoyed their warm hospitality.<br/>It was like a home away from home.  Their care came across in everything they did, from the welcome greeting with tea and cookies to the absolute great breakfast every morning looking out the garden.<br/>The accommodations were just like the pictures and the garden was glorious.<br/>An added plus was meeting and talking to the other guests over breakfast.<br/>We highly recommend Agri and Roger, we already miss talking with them and hope to see them again."
42010,254521,07-05-2011,529569,Nurul,We had a wonderful time while our stay there. Agri was a very helpful and lovely during our stay. The room is very cozy and clean. They have a beautiful garden and cuddly white cat that amused me. The breakfast prepared was even superb. Highly recommended!! :)
42010,263811,15-05-2011,447767,Spoma,"We had such a wonderful time.  Agri was a tremendous hostess.  Breakfast with her and the other guests could not have been better (what a cook).  From the moment we arrived, we were well taken care of--helping us get on our feet.<br/><br/>A wonderful family, home, and vacation for us!<br/><br/>Spoma & Lewis"
42010,267385,17-05-2011,416055,Francoise,We have been given the heartiest welcomes by Agri and her husband. They are so friendly and helpul. The breakfast is really a delight and copious with handmade cakes and fresh fruits. Address to be recommended for a visit in London.

42010,281627,26-05-2011,390917,Timo,"I certainly enjoyed my stay at Agri's. Everyone were very pleasant and quiet, the room was clean, and the bed was great - I slept well despite my concern of the nearby road being too busy.  A free internet-ready computer was at your use 24/7. <br/><br/>In my book, the breakfast was more than ""continental"" as I haven't seen blueberries, strawberries, various types of cheese, kiwis, or organic yoghurt included in those before. <br/><br/>To top it off, Agri offered to pay for my taxi drive to my airport shuttle as the tube wasn't running during those hours. Obviously, I'll stay there again should I have business to their locale again."
42010,289440,31-05-2011,348544,Jeff,"Agri and Roger are great hosts.  Starting with picking us up at the tube station in the rain after an overnight flight, to the great breakfasts with homemade scones, to helping us order delivery pizza for teenage sons at 11:30 at night.  Highly recommended."
42010,294540,02-06-2011,106678,Mathias,Great place to stay with a fantastic breakfast and nice hosts. It felt like beeing home! We defenitly will come back to stay with Agri and Roger next time.

42010,298190,05-06-2011,433668,Cindy,"We stayed for two nights last time and one night again when passing through London and it was fantastic. Breakfast is wonderful, Agri and her husband are lovely and helpful. The train station was so close that it was so easy to get into the city and exploe. Would definetly recommend staying here!!!"
42010,300949,06-06-2011,633686,Simon,"What a lovely place to stay. There are 7 guest rooms but everyone gets made to feel like part of the family. The rooms are spacious, well appointed, clean and great value. We had a lovely spread at breakfast, with views of the beautiful garden, and we enjoyed meeting a charming cat called Brian. We would definitely stay with Agri and Roger again. <br/>"
42010,306953,10-06-2011,616124,Chia Chia,"Agri & Roger had been wonderful hosts! <br/><br/>Very welcoming and helpful ...Breakfast was great too and the house has a homely feel ;) The neighbourhood is beautiful & peaceful and near walking distance to the East Finchley station that's well connected to town.<br/><br/>I'm travelling with my elderly mother and key issues would be the flights of steps in london's tube stations.<br/><br/>To reach Agri+Roger's place: would recommend for elderlys or persons with disability (especially if you have luggage) to take the cab from Paddington Station instead of trying the tube...took me about 30pounds on the london cab. <br/><br/>Leaving from Agri+Roger's place: Taking a Mini-Cab from Agri's place to the main train station took about 17pounds (thanks to Roger who made the taxi booking for me!)"
42010,319823,17-06-2011,692580,Lisa,"What a  lovely bnb with a gorgeous garden, lovely yummy breakfast and a very easy short walking distance from the tube station (Agri kindly gave us a lift from the station to the house as we had heavy suitcases).  Although we didn't have the same room both nights that we stayed there, they were both very nice.  The 1st room 'You will love this room' was excellent, a lovely open space, lovely view of the garden and next door to the shared bathroom.  The 2nd room 'You will save money here' was smaller but very nice (no garden view) but was at a cheaper rate for the night. West end in 20mins.  Night buses leave you practically outside the house.  Agri and Roger were very friendly and accommodating to our needs but we felt we had lots of privacy also.    They also gave lots of friendly and practical 'tourist' info for days out.  I would recommend you stay! "

Thank you Agri for making our trip to London wonderful. 
42010,397841,26-07-2011,617730,Lori,"We stayed one night in Agri and Roger's B&B. They are lovely people. Agri cares very much about making one's stay as enjoyable as possible. She had a wonderful assortment of cereals, croissants, scones, yougart, teas, coffees and juices available to choose from for breakfast. she even offered home made soup to us for dinner the night of our stay.<br/><br/>It was lovely to relax after our long journey in their garden enjoying a tea, their company and petting the cats.<br/>Thank you for your hospitality Agri and Roger."

42010,417312,03-08-2011,28454,Anne & Carl,"We had a delightful stay with Agri and Roger. They were very attentive hosts--willing to sit and chat and never made us feel rushed. Their home is charming and full of treasures (including the cats!) Breakfast each morning was delicious and surrounded by plants and flowers--their gardens are just lovely and we wished we could have stayed longer. Great meal at the pub down the road as well and the subway stop is a short walk from the house--all in all, a great experience!"

42010,455468,18-08-2011,816190,Christopher,"My girlfriend and I spent 3 nights here and we couldn't have been happier.  Agri and Roger were wonderful hosts.  They made us feel very welcome but also respected our privacy, which is important.  I worried that the place may not look like as nice as it did in the pictures, but they are spot on.  It's a beautiful place to stay, a 5 minute walk to the Tube, and about 25 minutes into the heart of London.  We were shocked to find such a value since London can be very pricey.  We would definitely stay here again. "
42010,457817,19-08-2011,690923,Nadine,"This was our first time using AirBnB and we had an absolutely splendid time staying with Roger and Agri in their charming home.

We hope to return sometime soon, it's the perfect place to stay!!"

We came from France.<br/>All what we've done was great !<br/>Agri and Roger were really lovely with us, always ready to help us if we needed to know something , they are so nice !<br/>The breakfast was a real good moment, because it was very good, and also because we shore it with others  persons on holidays who came from different countries.<br/>I really hope we can turn back to Agri and Roger's home when we'll go back to London one day because we'll never be able to forget them !"
42010,520289,11-09-2011,826375,Alessandra,"Exactly what a stranger wish for his staying in London: English style life, always tea in a cup, wood stairs covered by soft moquette, carpets in every room (bath included), a big garden (with colored flowers) more beautiful than in the photos, a pantagruelic breakfast prepared with passion, and, not last, two real kind guest: Agri and Roger, who have been always at our disposal.<br/>Alessandra and Bianca."

The house is clean, comfortable and in a good position for day and night transport (a night bus stops few meters/yards from the house). We really liked the UK-themed room with big closet and even basin in the room. There was a bit of noise in the night due to cars passing in the street but we noticed barely and got used immediately. Breakfast is big, various with delicious bakery, fresh fruits, jams, .... We would not hesitate a second to visit again Agri next time in London!"

Das Frühstück war reichhaltig, das Haus sauber und ordentlich. Es fehlte an nichts und die U-Bahn war nur 5 Gehminuten entfernt. <br/>Unser Zimmer war nach vorne zur Straße raus, aber wir waren nach den Ausflügen so geschafft, dass wir die Autos, die nachts noch fuhren gar nicht mehr registriert haben. :)<br/><br/>Wir kommen immer wieder gerne wieder !"

42010,694937,06-11-2011,883809,Gloria,"Blenheim Lodge is not simply a place to stay it is a true home away from home.  Agri and Roger are so warm, welcoming and attentive we felt truly special and cared for.  This is not what one typically dares to expect from strangers.  We were friends as soon as we stepped in the door.  We enjoyed meeting other guests from all over the world as well as the extensive daily breakfast offering.  Our room was cozy, clean and comfortable.  Agri even got up extra early to make sure we were taken care of on the morning we left."

Agri and Roger are lovely hosts, they serve a splendid breakfast in their dining room with a garden view, and they are very helpful. We met a number of other interesting guests from accross the planet. Our room was excellent. The B&B is very well-situated: near the tube station and in a neighbourhood full of walking opportunities. We'll certainly be back!"
42010,748069,27-11-2011,326752,Karen,"Agri and Roger gave us a brilliant first impression of the airbnb experience. (THANK YOU!)<br/>Very accomodating - our request to stay at their place was really last-minute and was glad of the quick response. <br/>Accessible -  Super close to the underground (and approx 3 miles from Ally Pally). <br/>Affordable - Really good value for money - especially if you need a safe place to park your car in London! <br/>Highly recommended!"

42010,787692,16-12-2011,653831,Luis,"Our stay at Blenheim House, in Finchley was a nice one,and we couldn't have chosen better. Conveniently located at walking distance from the Tube,from East Finchley station, and thence with the facility of connections through all the Tube network, it was quite easy for us to move around in London. Our room was spacious enough for a couple and the only thing it could not surpass was the warm welcome, when we first arrived by Agri, her husband Robert and their two cats. Finchley on itself, we thought, was a little gem of a place and we took the suggestion of our hosts and went and see Kenwood House and Estate, a marvelous property some half an hour walk from our house.Very nice too was the little park just near the railway station, with lots of very friendly squirrels who come down from the trees to salute you, expecting in return, some kindness from our side, translated in the offer of one or two biscuits.<br/>We enjoyed throughout our stay and will be more than pleased to recommend it to our friends, should they take the right decision to go and see the Olympic Games in London, this summer.<br/><br/>Isolina and António Graça<br/>"
42010,793370,19-12-2011,1424867,Lucy,"Agri and Roger were super, accommodating and welcoming hosts. Nothing was too much trouble for them. The room was super with everything we needed in a really pleasant and convenient location - excellent value too. "

42010,801161,23-12-2011,1308284,Jill,"After staying with Agri and Roger for close to a week, my boyfriend and I returned to the beautiful Blenheim Lodge after a quick trip to Dublin. We stayed in their first-floor room which was covered top to bottom in British flags and wonderful, iconic decorations.  The room was quite spacious and very comfortable, with a desk, bed, dual wardrobes and a sink.  The breakfast Agri and Roger provided every morning was fantastic -- croissants, muffins, toast, homemade scones, etc., and juice, tea, milk, etc.    Great location for a great price.  You really can't beat a five-minute walk to the underground and a great, authentic pub a few minutes away.  <br/><br/>Amazing hosts, a great location, and comfortable accommodations.  We had a great experience with Agri and Roger, and we can't wait to go back!"
42010,840306,06-01-2012,939100,Helga,"Our family stayed at Ford's House during the whole Christmas holiday. It was wonderful. Roger and Agri are very hospitable. Their victorian house is a real beauty, light and comfortable. This amazing place has a convenient location (5 min walk from the tube) and good service.<br/>Every morning Agri treated us with breakfast which was really delicious and rich. Agri is very sympathetic. She helped our friends from Saint Petersburg (who unexpectedly decided to join us on the NY eve) to find an extra accommodation for this period. And Roger had given a lot of advices for us how to stay in London.<br/>I recommend this place to every one with pleasure. <br/>We are going to stay at this house next time.<br/>Helga.<br/> <br/>Это удивительное и приятное место для визита в Лондон.<br/>Роджер и Агри - очень гостеприимные и дружелюбные хозяева. <br/>Все, что заявлено в описании - соответствует реальной жизни.<br/>Очень удобное расположение дома, 5 мин от метро. Завтраки были очень вкусными и выбор был большой.<br/>Вы можете обратиться с любой просьбой к хозяевам - они обязательно помогут решить вашу проблему или дадут совет.<br/>Мы бронировали 3 комнаты на семью и провели совершенно чудесные каникулы. В доме нет строгих ограничений и жестких правил. Мы свободно распоряжались своим временем, могли пользоваться кухней хозяев и при необходимости без проблем распечатывали он-лайн билеты на мероприятия. Наличие других постояльцев нисколько не мешало.<br/>Я рекомендую это место всем желающим посетить Лондон!"
42010,859919,13-01-2012,1520905,Allison,"Agri and Roger were really lovely and welcoming. The room was very clean and the location was fantastic.

42010,903965,06-02-2012,1547580,Sebastien,"Absolutely wonderful with an amazing breakfast : muffins, scones, croissants, bread, madeleines, jams, butter, cheese, nutella, cereal, milk, tea, coffee, soymilk. I really had a nice stay here and for a really good price. Our room was nice, clean and pleasant. The garden under the snow was really beautiful and the two cats so cuuuute !<br/>Moreover, we were 5 stations from Camden town (10-15min subway +5 min by foot). 2 or 3 more stations and we were at king's cross St pancras."
42010,910594,09-02-2012,1602787,Therese,"Not only will you save money there but you will have a pleasant stay, especially if you enjoy a comfy, simple, warmhearted welcome<br/>Pluses:<br/>Very friendly host<br/>Very good location near the East Finchley tube station on the Northern Line which is particularly convenient to access the city, soho and St Pancras station<br/>All necessary amenities: good bed, kettle, sink in the room to brush your teeth, wifi, good breakfast, very nice back garden, tv in the room<br/>caveats:  there seems to be a few guest rooms, hence the bathrooms can be busy in the early morning. My room on the street side was a bit noisy in the early morning but that did not stop me from sleeping like a log<br/>Munch better value for money and so much more fun than a classical hotel !"

She was very kind and loving and knowledgeable about London.  I highly recommend staying here.  It's a great value, great big breakfast overlooking the garden (birds singing).  She gave us a key so we could come and go as we pleased.  Just a five-minute walk to the train station and 20-25 minutes to most sights in London.  Perfect accommodations and a wonderful host.  If I make it back to London, I'd love to stay with Agri again."

42010,982270,09-03-2012,1575219,Sandy,Agri and Roger were amazing.  We arrived at 7.00am in the morning and they greeted us with smiling faces.

Would definitely stay their again.

Die Zimmer waren sauber und die Betten bequem! Ebenso das Badezimmer! Wir wurden warmherzig empfangen und bei jeder Frage standen Agri und Roger sofort zur Stelle! Das Frühstück war der absolute Wahnsinn! Besser als in jedem Sterne Hotel! Es gab jeden Tag Obstsalat aus frisch zubereiteten Früchten! Da ich Milcheiweiss Allergiker bin hat mir Agri ohne Probleme Sojamilch bzw. Yoghurt, Käse aus dem Bio Laden besorgt! Da unser nach Hause Flug erst spät Abends war, konnten wir bis zur Abfahrt auch ohne Probleme unsere Koffer bei ihnen unterstellen!  Die Krönung für unseren Aufenthalt gaben uns Bam Bam und Brian die zwei Katzen! "

42010,1059394,29-03-2012,184469,Jessica,I found Roger and Agri to be most welcoming.  There was a real warmth to the stay so that I found myself sleeping very well and feeling like I was visiting friends.  The house was comfortable and calm and it was a pleasure to chat away over breakfast about Spanish literature and writing before heading into London.  The fact that I could leave my bag until the evening was a great help.  Thanks again.  I Wouldn`t hesitate to recommend to anyone who would like a cosy and relaxed stay.
42010,1063827,31-03-2012,1725398,Matt,"Lovely hosts, nice room and good location close to the tube.  The garden was great scenery for my wife and I while eating breakfast."
42010,1068635,01-04-2012,1326634,Geraldine,"Great, quiet and safe location away from the central hustle and bustle, but very convenient to central London.

42010,1307227,20-05-2012,1635908,Evelyn,"Had a great stay With Agri & Roger...they were friendly, helpful, and had even stocked up on my favorite decaf tea (which they offered to send home with me)!  Other great things about Blenheim lodge include how handy the underground is and dinners at the Old White Lion.

42010,1393151,01-06-2012,1852447,Doreen,"Agri greeted us at the door, and gave us a brief tour of our lodging. I was traveling with my daughter and son-in-law, so we had separate bedrooms. My room was at the back side of the house, with a beautiful view of the garden, quiet, large and comfortable. The other bedroom was near the street side, and my daughter found the street noise interfered with her sleep. The shower is nice and roomy, the bathroom and bedrooms clean, and we appreciated having  keys to come and go as we pleased. Agri's breakfasts are delicious, with a wide variety of foods to choose from, including her delicious fruit salads. <br/>For those visiting London, it takes approximately 30 minutes by public transportation to get here, but this was worth it, considering how pricey accommodations in London are."
42010,1426443,06-06-2012,2214029,Paul,"The host and hostess were most welcoming, the bed was very comfortable, Even Brian the cat was very friendly towards us both.<br/>Our stay here represented very good value for our money, <br/>My wife and I were most delighted to be in such restful surroundings, <br/>The rear garden was a picture as it was being well cared for by Roger our host.<br/>There were good transport links by road and underground and ample off road car parking available.

We felt like living in a peaceful small English village - and we were 10 minutes far from Camden Town and 20 from Leicester Square!

42010,2026898,19-08-2012,1550535,Alison,"Agri and Roger were perfect hosts and their bed and breakfast was a joy to visit.  It was a wonderful home base for our London adventure.  Breakfast was surprisingly expansive for being continental and the view from the dining room over looking the garden was lovely. Our room was very comfortable and convenient being at the front of the house.  It was decorated with British kitsch.  Free wifi provided was also great since we used our smart phones to plan most of our tube travel into the city from East Finchley. <br/>We were sad to leave and would loved to have stayed longer.<br/><br/>"

42010,2220207,07-09-2012,1839712,Joy,"My mom and I had a great time at Agri & Roger's place. They were both really friendly and helpful. Their house is about a 5 minute walk to the metro station and about a 10 minute walk to the local pub, cafe, restaurants and supermarket. For those with a bad back, the beds are firm and not too soft. The next time we're in London, we'll definitely stay at their place again. "
42010,2235674,08-09-2012,2532555,Angelika,"Agri and Roger are  wonderful hosts. Helpful, warm and accessible. Highly recommended."
42010,2270285,12-09-2012,371848,Peter,Agri and Roger were charming hosts. I felt at home during my stay and the cats were a bonus. I'd stay there again.
42010,2273849,14-09-2012,1496502,Judy,Agri was a wonderful hostess staying up very late to accommodate our flight coming in two hours late!  She was extremely helpful with getting around as well. The metro is a short walk and easy to use.  Breakfast was in a lovely patio with a view of their beautifully landscaped yard.  Accommodations were comfortable and clean.  There is some traffic noise but it subsides by evening and is buffered by their property in front. We would definitely come back again!
42010,2298383,16-09-2012,1628065,Judith (Kaiya),"Roger greeted us as the door, tired travelers that we were: he was kind, thoughtful and warm, as we later found Agri to be. We needed food, and Roger expertly steered us to the White Lion where dinner was both delicious and nicely priced. Morning breakfast was a delight, and we met travelers from our country and others, all of whom were enjoyable to talk with. We would be most happy to stay with Roger and Agri again, and very likely will."

42010,2632915,16-10-2012,3287123,Vision,"What a wonderful bed and breakfast. I wanted a Victorian style setting and boy did it deliver! The room was tastefully decorated, had a nice TV, full-length mirror, water/tea, plug adapters (FTW!) for non-EU travelers, and THE most comfortable bed I've ever slept in. I only stayed one night so I didn't explore much of the premises, but the shower was nice and hot. There was a gorgeous, spacious garden. The breakfast buffet was held in a cute dining room with plenty to go around (coffee/milk/cereal/muffins/fruit/yogurt).<br/><br/>The neighborhood is quiet and the house very close to the Stockwell Tube station. Definitely check out the White Lion pub for ambiance, kind and friendly bartenders, and good hearty food/beer. <br/><br/>One tip for new travelers: On Sundays only, Stockwell Tube station, for 2012, is inaccessible due to construction so you'll have to take a bus that gets you to East Finchley. This can add up to 30min-1hr more transit time to your journey, not to mention it can be a very crowded, long experience on the bus, so try to arrive on some other day if you can!<br/><br/><br/>"

The room was very clean and well appointed. Access to the tube station is only a short walk, and East Finchley itself has many shops and amenities. This is a great place to stay in London."
42010,3134055,22-12-2012,3987176,Lena,"We are a young couple who stayed with Agri and Roger for three nights to enjoy London on the days before Christmas.

42010,3393535,22-01-2013,4441587,Iria Y Alberto,"La estancia en la casa de Agri & Roger fue fantástica, estuvimos 5 días de turismo por Londres y la casa era perfecta para movernos por la ciudad, tiene la parada de metro a escasos 200m.<br/>A destacar el desayuno tanto por la cantidad como por el sitio donde se sirve, con unas vistas preciosas a su jardín.<br/>Volveriamos a repetir experiencia en su casa sin dudarlo."

Nous disposions de notre propre clé donc aucun problème pour aller et venir. Le B&D est vraiment à côté de la station de métro, il suffit de descendre la route! La salle de bain était super et la douche juste parfaite si vous souhaitez prendre une douche à 4 ;-). Nous disposions d'un lavabo dans la chambre. Literie super confortable! Un ordinateur avec un accès internet est également disponible au premier étage de la maison. Chaque matin nous avons pu profiter du petit déjeuner (délicieux) face au jardin et cela avec croissant, muffin, scone, salade de fruits, café thé etc etc, vraiment tout ce que vous souhaitez ! <br/>Just perfect, Thank you!

The house was very cozy and the neighbourhood was peaceful and quiet. We also met Bambam and Brian who were very welcoming! The breakfast was very delicious too!<br/>Lanna was very helpful and cheerful, even though on our last night we accidentally woke her up at 3am! <br/>Thanks very much! :)"
42010,3513662,11-02-2013,3575547,Caroline,"Hi,<br/>Agri and Roger weren't there for our journey, so we met Lana, their daughter, who is very nice. The bedroom was confortable, britishely well-decorated and calm. The breakfast was litterally plentiful and delicious (in love with blueberry muffins). However, the only thing that we regret is that we haven't realised that it was a lodge, so we would have liked more discussions with the inhabitant."

After a hearty breakfast with a lovely view on their garden we were ready to explore London. The house is very well situated, in 15 minutes by tube you are anywhere in London! For both the place and Agri and Roger's kindness I would recommend this accomodation."
42010,3771184,13-03-2013,4431633,Matthew,"It was such a pleasant time staying with Roger and Argi.  They were very wonderful people.  If you are ever going to London I would suggest trying to stay with them over a hotel.  Everything you could need was provided for (shampoo, towels, etc.).  Argi even had a huge breakfast ready every single morning.  The beds are extremely comfortable as well, so you will surely get a good night's sleep.  They were very informative as well.  Our trip got delayed one night on the way to our next destination, and they had no problem accommodating us for one extra night.  We had a great time with time. "

42010,4061118,07-04-2013,4673816,Marina,Agri & Roger are very nice hosts. My son and my mother have stayed at Blenheim Lodge for seven days (April 2013).

Breakfast was delicious and the eating area overlooked their beautiful back garden area.  The location was great for getting in and out of London being close to the underground station.  The room itself was perfect for our unique tastes, and the occasional visit from Bambam (their cat) made us feel right at home.  We would recommend this home to anyone and look forward to when we can return!"

42010,4470944,07-05-2013,5095619,Marjan,It is a lovely place to stay if you are visiting London. They are very friendly. The underground is nearby. You are in the centre of London in no time. 
42010,4528375,11-05-2013,4979963,Margerie,"  Agri and Roger are friendly and helpful. Don't hesitate to express your needs (a very quiet room, an extra mattress...). If they can arrange things, they'll do.(Within the limits of the reasonable).<br/>I liked sharing with them and the other guests. It was simple and enriching.<br/>So, if you  are waiting for a family atmosphere, about 15 mn from downtown, the place will please you.<br/>  Nous avons très bien accueilli par le couple. Agri est présente et disponible. Une fois votre clé en main vous êtes libres de vos horaires. Le petit déjeuner est copieux : céréales, pain de mie en tout genre, scones, yaourts, fromage...J'ai été très contente de mon séjour. Ce sont vraiment des gens charmants."

42010,4786714,26-05-2013,5355344,Holly,Agri and Roger's place was wonderful.  We were surprised how easy it was to get to from the Underground and was located in a very nice area.  Everything in the room was clean and comfortable and the large breakfast provided in the morning was great.  I would recommend staying here if you are in London.

It seams that everything is going fine with them and it is. The house is a yewel. We enjoyed the breakfast and the chats with the other gests.

42010,5148729,15-06-2013,6521936,Sára,"We stayed at Blenheim Lodge only for 2 days, but we are sure that this was the best accommodation for us. Agri & Roger are very nice and helpful and their home is also really beautiful and comfortable. The room where we stayed was well-equipped with all the necessary things we needed. We really loved it!!! The breakfast was delicious and enormous, and the view from the breakfast room was really very beautiful!!! The house is situated in a very safe and nice area, and is really close to the city centre. We were in the city within 20 minutes. The metro station was also very close, only 5 minutes walking. So it couldn't be in a better place!!! We are very happy that we choose Agri & Roger's place and we are sure that during our next visit in London we will stay here again!! We recommend this place for everybody!<br/><br/>Thank your Agrti & Roger!<br/><br/>Sára & Zsófia (from Hungary)"
42010,5204878,18-06-2013,5282123,Pete,"A wonderful place to stay, particularly friendly and homely. safe parking, close to tube station, lovely house and people. There was a Tiawanese women and her teenage son staying there at the same time as us, their first visit to Europe. They will never know how lucky they were to find Agri and Roger to stay with and look after them and see the best of our culture. One of the things we liked best was the absence of formality, everything was so easy-going and relaxed, totally non-fuss."
42010,5270936,22-06-2013,1400103,Peter,agri and roger were the best hosts making us feel welcome  . we think the stay was the best part of stay in the uk we would stay with them again with no worries we would like to call them friends .we would recommend them to other travellers.
42010,5376236,27-06-2013,5271284,Linda,Our stay with Agri and Roger was really nice. Our room was in the front of the house so we didn't have to worry about waking anyone up when we came in. We didn't have to share the bathroom with anyone else which made it easy for us. We also had a sink in our room which was nice. Agri prepares a huge breakfast with many different selections. The atmosphere is relaxing and we felt very comfortable. We got the hang of the Metro and getting back and forth from sightseeing was easy. We would recommend anyone coming to London to stay with Agri and Roger.
42010,5522401,04-07-2013,2866900,Luca,"Agri e Roger sono molto accoglienti ed ospitali. la camera è molto carina e rifornita di elementi utili ad un soggiorno confortevole (bollitore, tazze , phon, spine universali). la casa ha un bellissimo giardino e la colazione è ottima e abbondante. al prossimo ritorno a Londra torneremo sicuramente qui "
42010,5575708,07-07-2013,4611934,Stephanie,"I had a lovely at the Bleihem Lodge.  The hosts were very friendly and always made sure I was comfortable and having a great stay.  The house is absolutely beautiful, the room was the perfect size and the sink was incredibly convenient. The bed was so comfortable that it made waking up early more difficult :).  The breakfast room was a great place to start a day with a view of the beautiful garden and of course the breakfast itself was delicious, had a lot of diversity and definitely something for every taste.  The neighborhood is also very safe and charming. A typical English neighborhood.  Without a doubt, I strongly recommend this place to anyone traveling to London as it is very easy to get to Central London in about 10 minutes by Underground. I, with all honesty, would absolutely love to come back during my next stay in London!  <br/><br/>Stephanie"
42010,5657932,10-07-2013,6008485,Isabel,"We had the perfect stay with Roger & Agri in East Finchley. <br/>They are such beautiful people, and so accommodating and hospitable. The house is gorgeous, with a beautiful garden, lovely spacious room, access to the kitchen and toilet, and is in a quiet location that is only a very short walk from the tube. The breakfast supplied was very enjoyable and well above the usual cereal and toast.<br/>We would stay there again in a heart beat! Thank you both for such a wonderful experience, especially as we are first timers to Airbnb."
42010,5693019,12-07-2013,5313286,Hannah,Our hosts were very welcoming and made us feel like we were at home! The breakfast spread was rather generous and Agri and Roger accommodated our every need. The neighbourhood was wonderful. A pleasure to stay in East Finchley!

42010,5999227,26-07-2013,3148232,Rosemarie,"We had a wonderful stay with Agri and Roger who were such welcoming hosts. The house is beautiful and peaceful, with a great garden, and all the guests we met there were very nice people. Great breakfast with homemade scones and a variety of cheeses and more. A perfect location close enough to East Finchley Station, and also close to Camden. We highly recommend it!"
42010,6155450,01-08-2013,6698920,Chiaihao,I really enjoyed my stay in Agri and Roger's place. The room is in lovely British decoration. The price is so nice to stay in such fabulous place. The breakfast was the best!!! It feels like a big feast!!!

42010,6552848,17-08-2013,5366841,Sandrine,"It was the firsth time for my son Florian and I in London. It was a real pleasure to stay for a week at Agri and Roger's house, Blenheim Lodge. Everything was absolutely perfect ! Agri, Roger and friend Teresa were always available for any request, the room was very comfortable,  and the breakfast was incredible ! And it takes only five minutes walking to bus or tube station.<br/>If my son and I had the opportunity to return in London, there is no doubt : we would try to go to Blenheim Lodge again !"
42010,6652663,20-08-2013,5708434,Emilia,"It's a beautiful place to live. It's clean and all facilities are provided. Both Roger and Agri are kind and welcoming.<br/>Plenty of breakfast, almost similar to the hotel. <br/>It's in Zone 3. Transportation is not too bad.<br/>The closest station is East Finchley and its only 5 mins walk. But if there's no train in the weekend due to maintenance then you have to take bus to Kings Cross.<br/>Overall it's good value!"
42010,6864585,28-08-2013,3012342,Amanda,"Blenheim Lodge was our first airbnb experience and it set the benchmark very high! Great, safe and convenient location, lovely hosts, plentiful breakfast and the lodge and room is beautiful. Would recommend to anyone visiting London. "
42010,7066536,05-09-2013,6856203,Mariana,"I can't recommend Agri and Roger enough. I had to cancel one of my 2 reservations because of illness and Roger was very lovely and understanding. Agri is such a nice person!!<br/>The house is gorgeous, impeccably kept and Agri is the best host you could wish for. Lovely house, lovely rooms, near the station. 5*!"
42010,7136083,08-09-2013,874943,Mary,We deliberately chose to stay extra time because our hosts made us feel so welcome and their location o convenient....
42010,7160108,09-09-2013,874943,Mary,"This is the second time in three years that we have had the opportunity to visit London from the US, and we automatically chose Agri and Roger's BnB. Their home is located close to the underground; each of the rooms we've stayed in were more than comfortable and the morning breakfast with other guests provided a chance to learn traveling trips and share experiences. But most important, Agri and Roger provide a homey feeling....One last plus...their garden is oh so beautiful! You'll have a delightful time. "
42010,7237460,13-09-2013,6125602,Zhen,"We stayed at A LOT of apartments during our month long Europe trip and even though we stayed with Agri and Roger on the first night, it was still fresh in our minds at the end of the trip as one of the fondest memories of the trip. We had great expectations from reading the reviews and were not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>Agri and Roger are amazing hosts who went out of the way to make our lives more convenient. From driving us to the ATM in the rain to making sure our taxi is confirmed for the lowest price possible and arrived on time when we left for the airport. The continental breakfasts were a nice touch which gave you a chance to speak to other tourists and guests while choosing from a buffet of breakfast menus. You can tell they have a genuine passion for providing the best possible service from the moment you meet them.<br/><br/>The apartment is roughly 5 minutes walk from a station that is very close to central London and roughly 45mins-1hr via train to the airport. There are lots of multi-cultural restaurants, supermarkets, cleaning services and pubs near by so if you don't want to eat/drink/shop at tourist trap places in central London, this is a refreshing alternative.<br/><br/>The bedroom itself was very spacious and had its own sink and vanity mirror. The sound proofing was very nice and we did not hear anything from outside our bedroom throughout the nights we stayed, but that may be because we are quite heavy sleepers! The view from the garden was amazing (the pictures don't do it justice) with comfortable outdoor tables and chairs, however we didn't get a chance to use that at all due to the constant rain that London is all too famous for.<br/><br/>There are 2 shared bathrooms and both are roomy and were equipped with everything you need inside. The kitchen was fully stocked and we were able to borrow everything we needed, upon returning the plates and cups Agri and Roger's daughter helped us clean up. We felt really spoilt and guilty.<br/><br/>If you want a traditional 5 star London experience I would definitely recommend. Will be staying here when I do revisit London. It will be very, very difficult to beat both the value and the luxury provided by Agri and Roger."
42010,7389388,18-09-2013,1475308,Vivadhana,"We stayed in the front room of the house, most ideal of many rooms. We had total peace and quiet, great TV, good room and loved our interaction in the wonderful garden room over a well presented breakfast. Agri is a delight as is Roger. This has been our favorite place in all our visits."
42010,7503057,23-09-2013,4008234,Beverly,"Our stay with Roger and Agri was everything we expected it to be, especially for it being my first time in London, and my husband's second. Breakfast was always warm and cozy each morning, charmingly set in a sun room overlooking an amazing garden. Our room displayed the epitome of British pride, which was so sweet. The train station was minutes away, which made it easy to get around. The ONLY issue we had- which was our own fault for not putting two and two together with images of a cat on their profile- was the cats. My husband and I had pretty bad allergic reactions, but it wasn't anything Benadryl couldn't fix. Other than that, our experience at Roger and Agri's was just wonderful. We would love to stay here again should we make another trip out to London. We highly recommend this place! Thanks again, Roger and Agri! "
42010,7806224,04-10-2013,6123286,Joan,"We had a great time staying in Blenheim Lodge.  We loved our British themed room.  It was very cozy and clean.

42010,7992386,11-10-2013,1668546,Liz,"Agri and Roger are lovely, welcoming hosts who make you feel instantly at ease in their home. I arrived late and left early both days but I can vouch for a varied and plentiful breakfast with view onto the garden, a comfy bed and  friendly conversation or privacy in the morning, depending on what you want. Convenient distance from the tube station. I would stay here again."
42010,8174174,19-10-2013,9074110,Mary,"Agri and Roger are perfectly suited as international hosts!  They are warm, welcoming, and helpful with our many questions as first-time travelers.

42010,8439770,30-10-2013,7173730,Blair,Nice room. Zone 3. Internet worked well. Nice breakfast too. There was a storm and Roger let me know what was happening with transportation news to what was shutdown and gave very helpful travel advice. I would definitely stay here again. 
42010,8477519,02-11-2013,7125479,Robyn,"We stayed in 2 rooms at Blenheim Lodge and both were great.  Loved the England room, very quirky and waking up to the garden from our Garden Room was lovely.  Agri and Roger were great hosts, very helpful but not intrusive.  The breakfast was amazing and East Finchley an easy ride to the city each day. Also the cats were a bonus.  Would recommend Blenheim Lodge to anyone.<br/>Robyn<br/>Australia"
42010,8608272,08-11-2013,5955126,Ngai-Chiu (Jerry),This is the best place to stay in London. The hospitality and value is unbeatable. I highly recommend this place to anyone who will visit London. It is quite accessible from the London underground and I found it very convenient. It is a nice quiet place in the suburb of London. I love it.

42010,8712795,13-11-2013,6840989,June,"This is our 1st Airbnb experience and we were excited about it! (Visited 10-12/11/2013)<br/>After a long flight, finally we arrived London and reached Agri and Roger's house in the early morning. We were warmly welcomed by Roger and Agri with a yummy English breakfast while waiting for other guest to check out. Although we saw their pictures in Airbnb, we were still surprised by their beautiful dining room (not to mentioned their lovely flower porcelain plates and cups!!) and stunning garden view! Cutie-furry Bumbum also welcomed, meowing and looked at us near door side! How adorable!!  We felt very warm just like at home!<br/>It is hard to describe how comfortable and warm the bed was (Especially after a long walk) we love the theme too! Beside answering all our questions, Agri and Roger also carefully prepared so many guide books and metro and city map to ensure our happy smooth trip! Where can you get such a sincere friendly host like Agri and Roger?<br/>We glad that we made a right choice and will definitely highly recommend to our friends! :)"
42010,8738736,15-11-2013,4828087,Kate,Had a wonderful stay for 2 nights. Breakfast was awesome!
42010,8782999,18-11-2013,8865685,Kerry,I really enjoyed staying here. We woke up late for breakfast but was still accommodated for. which was very nice. The room was big and bright.

42010,8893492,24-11-2013,2619235,Alexander,"We really loved staying with Agri and Roger! The hosts were extremely friendly and welcoming and we felt really at home there.  The room was tidy and clean, though a bit cold, so don't forget your pyjamas if you come here in the colder months of the year. The continental breakfast was a joy and it was nice to chat with the other guests at the breakfast table or just enjoy the beautiful garden view. Internet worked as promised.<br/><br/>The B&B was easy to find after just a 5 min walk from the tube station, very handy.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, we must not forget the charming cats roaming about the house, we miss having them around :) <br/><br/>In conclusion: We'd love to come back and stay here next time we're in London and can warmly recommend Agri and Roger. You won't find a cheaper better place than this. "

The room was great and clean for two of us and we were so happy with lovely breakfast they provided every morning in lovely room over looking their back yard. The accomodation was very close to the metro station. We really enjoyed staying there and if we visit London we would definately like to stay at Agri and Roger's place, highly recommend to anyone. Thank you so much Agri and Roger. <br/>"

42010,9224673,15-12-2013,8301765,Juliane,"It was a really nice experience to stay at Agri and Roger's Lodge! We slept 3 nights at East Finchley and really enjoyed it. You have a direct subway to Leicester Square. The bedroom is just perfect (the bed also!!). Breakfast : really good and huge!... with a garden view :)<br/>Roger and Agri are more than nice. Don't hesitate to go there! You will love it for sure ;)<br/><br/>Le lodge de Agri et Roger est situé à East Finchley, à environ 25min de métro de King Cross et Trafalgar Square. Très bon compromis si vous ne voulez pas payer trop cher et être près du centre de Londres. Ils sont très accueillants, vraiment! Ils m'ont même offert un cadeau pour mon anniversaire, lors du petit déjeuner, adorables! <br/>La chambre est très bien, très bonne literie! Le petit déjeuner est copieux et servis dans la salle à manger, face au jardin. N'hésitez pas à rencontrer ces formidables hôtes !"

They are clearly experienced Airbnb hosts, and know how to keep the guests happy, and comfortable.  Frankly, it's better than a hotel!"
42010,9328612,22-12-2013,653101,Logan,"Agri and Roger were great hosts and served breakfast every morning. Google maps had the location slightly off but Agri came to guide me to their place. The location, though conveniently located next to an underground stop, is somewhat far from downtown London. The tradeoff is that the location is more secluded and has a beautiful backyard."
42010,9380378,25-12-2013,8405627,Amanda,"It's my first time trying out airbnb and the stay at Agri&Roger definitely made it a very pleasant maiden experience. <br/>The location was good, situated very near the tube.

They are lovely hosts, the room was nice and clean and the breakfast was great and plentyful. Very good price/quality-balance. <br/>After arrival we had lunch at the Old White Lion, a typical British pub nearby (between their house and the tube). A very nice place with simple but good food. Tip; you have to order at the bar! <br/>"

42010,9861893,15-01-2014,7684203,Gabriel,"Very nice place with helpful and kind hosts.

The room is exactly how it looks like in the photos, or better. Mrs Ford is such a nice person and everything was just perfect. The bed, the blankets, the entire room. Everything very clean and organized. The breakfast is AMAZING. The hosters are very friendly and helpful. The neighborhood is very beautiful and there's lots of good pubs, bars and restaurants nearby. Also it's a few steps from a underground (metro) station, witch make things even easier. This is a strongly recommended place for everyone! We will certainly come back to this place in our next visit. =)"

42010,11147047,23-03-2014,7043057,Martin Ezequiel,"Agri y Roger son excelentes anfitriones y su casa es hermosa. Tiene todo lo necesario para estar muy a gusto. El desayuno es muy bueno, por la comida y porque se comparte con otras personas que también están de viaje, y uno tiene la posibilidad de intercambiar experiencias y conocer sus vidas. Nos sentimos muy cómodos. Los baños son compartidos, pero eso no representa ningún problema en lo más mínimo, siempre estuvieron espléndidos. La ubicación es un poco alejada del centro de Londres, pero se compensa con la tranquilidad y la belleza del barrio. Además, es muy cómodo para transportarse en autobús o en metro. Simplemente no tenemos nada negativo para comentar. Agri y Roger gracias por habernos hospedado en su casa y hacer que nuestra estadía en Londres sea la mejor de todos los lugares de Europa dónde estuvimos en este viaje."
42010,11318881,30-03-2014,7723394,Anthony,WE LOVE LOVE LOVE Agri and Roger! The location and their home was so unbelievable welcoming. We had a delicious breakfast every morning and got to know the other guest as well. Its a very clean and very quiet house. Its a 5 minute walk from the tube and the town has lovely restaurants as well. Plus its only 20minutes by the tube to city center. We would stay with them every time. Thank you so much and we look forward to our next visit to London!

42010,11824347,16-04-2014,9587925,Mateja,"Staying at Agri & Roger's beautiful old house was amazing. They are great and lovely hosts providing you everything you need. The room was clean, fresh and had everything we needed. It's great that we had a sink in our room although using the shared bathroom wasn't a problem at all. It was also clean and very practical. They serve a wonderful breakfast with a picturesque view of the garden where you get the chance to see a squirell stilling and eating tulips (we saw it twice :). The tube is a few minutes from their house which makes it easy to get to the center. There is also a lovely pub nearby where you can enjoy a pint. Highly recommended and we are definitely coming back.<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/>Mateja&Mark"

They welcomed us with a cup of tea when we arrived, and were super lovely to chat with. The breakfast provided was awesome, lots of options!  Fruit, yogurt, cereals and pastries galore!  The location was nice and quiet, yet just a short walk to the tube to get to the action.  (20-40 min, depending on where/time of day.)  I showered at night, and always found the bathroom to be available despite other visitors being there.  I highly recommend staying with them, and hope to do so next time we find ourselves in London.      "

42010,13172959,21-05-2014,9112655,Mariana,The hospitality that Agri and Roger showed us is five star. They were both helpful before I arrived and while I was there. Each morning we were greeted with a lovely continental breakfast and hot coffee. There were so many things to choose from! Agri and Roger were kind enough to help us out with our plans and provide us with the best route in getting there. The service was amazing! Being my first experience off of Air B&b I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. However I can certainly tell you that whatever place I stay at next has some pretty big shoes to fill! I would definitely recommend this location to friends/family. Centrally located and you couldn't ask for nicer people!!
42010,13243695,23-05-2014,13754762,Kim,"We had a great stay with Agri and Roger.  Their place is just far enough outside the busy part of London to get a little peace and quiet, but close enough to hop on the tube and arrive at Big Ben within 30 minutes.  We enjoyed out stay there and also had a great time meeting and getting to know all of their other guests during breakfast."

42010,13811407,05-06-2014,12121142,Ardy,"Me and my friend had a lovely time at Agri's and Roger's home. They were very friendly, welcoming and helpful. The room was very nice and clean, and so was the rest of the house. Breakfast was also great. They serve a lot of different things, which are all very nice. The fact that the house is near to an underground station is very handy if you're planning to travel/see a lot in Londen, like we did. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
42010,14423026,19-06-2014,11524587,Ariel,非常推薦這間民宿，房間非常舒適，加上每天早上都有房東準備的豐富早餐，喜歡大自然的人，在民宿內就可以享受自家花園，要去市區也很方便，步行約5分鐘左右就是地鐵站。房東非常親切，還有隻愛撒嬌的貓，這裡也會有其他來自世界各地的住客，彼此也可以交流旅遊行程。若有親友要來倫敦我一定會推薦這裡!
42010,14549204,22-06-2014,1937872,Stephen,"We stayed with Agri and Roger on 18 to 21Jun14. We had the most wonderful time with them. They are the friendliest people you could ever meet. There little cat is just so adorable. Both our Airbnb and face to face communication was splendid. They provided us with excellent directions from Heathrow along with tips to survive our stay in London. The continental breakfast was superb and presented in the most charming setting overlooking their gorgeous garden that hosts a fox or two and some lovely little squirrels. The tube is just a 5 minute walk up the road, and you are into the city in 30 minutes. Stay with these folk, they are wonderful."

La maison est conforme à la description, bien située par rapport au métro et au centre de Londres (20mn en métro).<br/>Le petit déjeuner est très divers et varié, il y en a pour tous les goûts.<br/>J y étais avec ma fille de 15 ans et avons fait de belles rencontres  autour du petit déjeuner justement ! <br/>Je recommande vivement ."
42010,16053132,21-07-2014,11796339,Bart,"A rich breakfast is waiting on you after a quit night in the lovely house with big and beautiful garden. Agri and Roger are willing to help whenever you ask for something. The house was crowdy when we went there, but it never felt as a problem. It's a good opportunity to get involved with other people from all over the world (we met New-Zeelanders, Americans, Taiwan people and some French). The only minor about our room was the matrass of the bed who was to soft and wobbly. Very easy to get to the city center, good public transport is very nearby. An adress to remember when we will visit London again. (Bart and Katrien from Belgium - july 2014)  "
42010,16215641,23-07-2014,16910481,Amandine,"My sister and I came from Southern California and had never stayed at an airbnb before. Agri and Roger definitely helped set the standards bar very high. The accommodations were amazing and their hospitality was warming. They even let us borrow an umbrella when it was raining. The location was perfect. They were a quick walk to the Tube leading into central London.  If I am fortunate enough to visit London again, I wouldn't imagine staying anywhere else but with Agri and Roger. They were amazing hosts that set up their lodge as a quaint, comfortable and welcoming bed and breakfast with charm and sophistication. "
42010,16335966,26-07-2014,8440792,Vivien,Agri and Roger are wonderful hosts. They are very nice and lovely to talk to. They gave us great advice on where to go and how to get there. The day we checked in we were even offered breakfast without having paid for it. And the day we checked out we could leave our luggage at their place until we had to leave the city. The room was very nice and clean. Its only a 5 minute walk to the underground and there are a couple restaurants close by. We really didnt have anything to complain about. By the way their backyard is beautiful and perfectly suited for a nightime read :)
42010,16885885,04-08-2014,13919149,Jakub,"Absolutely perfect. Hosts were really nice and helpful, house amazing and beautiful, in very quiet and safe neighborough. and the tube is very near.<br/>room was exactly the same as on the pictures and clean and there was a shelf with free tea, coffee, etc.<br/>Breakfasts were wonderful, there were many kinds of food and drink and everything in great amount. It was also very pleasant to talk to other visitors during the breakfast while enjoying the view to the garden.<br/>In conclusion, everything was perfect and we really enjoyed our stay."
42010,17259081,10-08-2014,4533156,Nancy,"Agri and Roger are the nicest, friendliest, most helpful people we have met on our trip. They made us feel welcomed, and yet out of their way to help me with some special needs I had. They would arrange transportation for us, and explained the tube system and provided us with maps.<br/><br/>Our room was wonderful, and much more than than we were expecting. There neighborhood is very nice and quiet and clean and safe. There is a lovely pub with good food just two blocks from the lodge, and the tube station is right next to that.<br/><br/>The breakfast they serve is also wonderful with much more than you would expect from a continental style breakfast with scones, muffins, hot drinks, juice, muffins,cereals, yogurts, fresh fruit salad, and so much more. <br/><br/>I would definitely stay here again, and would be very disappointed if I couldn't get a booking."

42010,18561257,28-08-2014,19322553,Bianca,"This was my first experience ever staying in a B&B and Agri and Roger couldn't have been a better first experience. They are so warm and friendly and we were invited for breakfast the morning we arrived. The room was cosy, very neat and had everything we needed. We met different and very interesting people every morning at the breakfast table and a lot of traveling experiences were shared. I had a lovely time in London and staying with Agri and Roger gave us the feeling that we were staying at a long lost family-member instead of in a B&B. I am planning another trip to London by the end of the year and hopefully Agri and Roger will have a room for us again."

They made me very at home, in fact at times I felt like it was my home.  The breakfast was lovey, sitting at the table with different visitors as they came and went.  The breakfast table overlooks a most beautiful garden, and everyone one thoroughly enjoyed themselves at this warm and friendly house.  Agri and Roger were very helpful and supplied me with information regarding transportation and the easiest routes to travel.  I hope to visit them again in the future. "

I didn't have any problem to find her house cause she gave us detail direction in advance.
42010,21131011,12-10-2014,6171782,Mark,"This is a great B&B.  As you enter, the welcome smell of incense alerts you to the care Roger and Agri take to make you feel at home.  The place is spotless. They think of everything to ensure that your stay is brilliant in every way.  Although there is no ensuite, it is never a problem.  They attract a great mix of travellers, students and businessmen from all over, and the communal breakfast overlooking the beautiful garden is a new fun experience every day.  They are available to help you in every way, but are happy to give you all the space you need.  The high street is fabulous, eat and drink at the Bald Faced Stag or eat great Indian food at Quality (we know the name sounds bad, but the food is really good), and there's a great old bookstore.  Lovely off street parking in a beautiful house that can be your home while in London.  We have been back several times and have recommended it to friends."

Wonderful couple, wonderful garden and wonderful breakfast! With them, we feel right at home, in London, and from Singapore! Thank you both so much for all that you have done for us. London made all the difference because of both of you! :)"
42010,21939900,27-10-2014,17972645,Danijela,"We had a great time staying at Agri&Rogers. <br/>We arrived a little before regular check in time and our room was ready. The room was the same as in the pictures, clean and comfy. We had glasses, mugs, coffee, tea and a water cooker at our disposal.<br/>Agri welcomed us and gave us useful information about the city and public transportation. The instructions to reach the house were accurate and reaching East Finchley from London centre was no problem at all. <br/>The underground gets you there fast, and while you ride you have the time to go through the plans for the attractions you want to visit. We saved much on accomodation, and either way had the Oyster card which got us around town.<br/>The breakfast was plentiful, with a great look at the garden. We met other guests at the breakfast table and exchanged valuable information with them.<br/>Would highly recommend."

The breakfast was rich, and the pastries were fresh. The room was clean and real close to an easily approachable underground station. <br/>Everything was perfect and Agri's & Roger's recommendations on nearby sights and parks were just priceless. "

Le petit déjeuner le matin est délicieux, plus particulièrement les muffins maison (Blueberry muffins) et le thé vert.

The room was exactly as pictured on the website and very comfortable, private and homely.<br/>The neighbourhood was safe and walking distance to the tube was easy and only about 8 mins away.<br/>Roger and Agri were so helpful when I needed information to get around and especially when I had to bring my daughter to the hospital, she helped me call a cab.<br/>The breakfast was a wide spread and coffee and many diff kinds of tea was available.  Toilets were always available when we needed them even though there seemed to be other guests staying in the other rooms. Bath soap, shampoo, towels were adequately provided.<br/>I will definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in a friendly atmosphere and safe surroundings."
42010,23859780,13-12-2014,2818864,Amy,"We had a wonderful stay. Roger and Agri were very welcoming and the accommodations were excellent. The location is in a quiet area north of all the London excitement (which was good for sleeping because we stayed for the other half of our trip closer in the city and it was loud!), but it is very close to a tube station where you can get around to anything you need. We were very pleased with our stay at the lodge and will stay there again if we go back!"
42010,24019882,17-12-2014,19222451,Tracy,It was lovely to meet Agri & Roger.<br/>We had an enjoyable stay. Great only being a short walk away to the Tube Station and The Local Pub!<br/>

42010,28440807,23-03-2015,29382082,Auburn,"Agir was very kind and welcoming. I arrived at 12:30 and was instantly welcomed into the house. The room was very spacious for two of us and was well kept. It's possible to hear a bit of road noise but it's not enough to keep you up at night. The neighborhood felt very safe even when coming back at midnight. It is a bit of a trek from Heathrow on the underground, so be prepared for that. It's also a bit up the road from the underground station but an easy walk without luggage. Breakfast was good and there were several options. Overall it was a great place for us to stay and to come back to after a long day. We will definately stay here again when we return to London. "

Their home is closed to the tube and on the direct line from the St Pancras' station and to the center of London (Northern Line), this location is very practice for a week-end trip. Breakfast is also included! A very good address to enjoy few days in London."
42010,29909360,14-04-2015,26567423,苡霆,房子離地鐵站很近，就在一條舒服漂亮的街道上，如果不想在倫敦市區人擠人，從街道上的公車站隨意坐上公車逛街也非常舒服；謝謝Agri & Roger的招待，雖然我英文不是太好，但Agri & Roger還是會在碰面時跟我們聊天，早餐在非常漂亮的花園前，邊吃早餐還可以看到鴿子、松鼠、烏鴉在搶麵包非常有趣! 有機會一定還想再拜訪這間房子:)

42010,30983917,30-04-2015,24047120,Angela,"Mi experiencia en la casa de Agri & Roger fue de lo mejor. Partiendo por la casa que es de lo mas hermosa y muy acogedora. La atención y disposición de ellos excelente, tuve que dar su dirección para el envió de cierta documentación (en forma previ a a mi estadía), a lo cual accedieron inmediatamente.  Uno de los grandes puntos de esta opción (dentro de todo lo que ya es bueno) es sin duda el desayuno que incluye, repleto de cosas deliciosas.<br/>Si bien no esta en el centro de Londres, el transporte hacia el mismo y demás lugares de interés es muy directo, el metro se encuentra a 5 min caminando de la casa ( una de las lineas con conexión hacia todos lados).<br/>Definitivamente mi próxima estadía en Londres sera donde Agri&Roger nuevamente."

We had a great stay, the room looked just like shown on the pictures and was very clean and really cozy. <br/>We got to know Roger and his lovely nice Raquel from Paraguay. Both were very friendly and helpful and the communication before and during our trip was easy and promptly.  <br/>The included breakfast was really good and nutritious and offered the possibility to have some really nice chats with the other guests from America and Australia. <br/>We can really recommend the place as it is not too far outside from the city center and easy to reach via the local underground. <br/>Definitely worth a stay! <br/>"

Agri and Roger were very welcoming from the moment we met them and we can't recommend them highly enough.<br/><br/>Our room was lovely, and the Lodge is located in a great spot, only a few minutes walk to the township, transport, and of course the local pub.<br/><br/>The breakfast provided was all you could ever want, and it was nice to mingle with the other guests over breakfast and looking out across the gardens.

The breakfast was lovely and beautifully set each morning. We felt very welcomed and loved our stay. A home away from home. Would highly recommend :) "

Die Anbindung mit öffentlichen Verkehrsmitteln war super. Der Frühstücksraum mit Blick auf den tollen Garten, haben wir sehr genossen, es war abwechslungsreich und für jeden Geschmack etwas dabei. Wenn wir wieder einen Lodontrip planen sollten, werden wir sehr gerne wieder bei Agri und Roger unterkommen, da sie sehr gastfreundlich und überhaupt nicht aufdringlich waren."

It is a small room but adequate and has a vanity sink which is useful in saving some trips to the main bathroom which is a short walk away through the house.  There is plenty of wardrobe space, the bed is very comfortable and the decor very British.  I would recommend this room if you are staying a few nights and don't need a lot of space."

Comfy bed. <br/>Very hospitable hosts and happy to help with anything. <br/>Close to tube station so handy for getting round. Walking distance to Hampstead Heath too.

Enjoyed sitting in their cosy living hall having lovely chit chat sessions with them, feel like home. <br/>Before the trip I have received lot useful information from Roger and all questions I have to him were promptly replied. <br/>It is not located centrally in London but just a mere 15 mins tube ride to SOHO and a lovely 5 mins walk from East Finchley station. <br/>Just be noted if traffic noise is not acceptable to you while sleeping, would suggest for room upstairs as the traffic at night could affect your sleep (but not an issue to us at all). <br/>All in all, great stay great experience, will definitely go back again when back in London.

42010,59566148,12-01-2016,1839712,Joy,"This is my second time staying with Agri & Roger and I couldn't be more satisfied with my visit. <br/>I have a pinched nerve in my lower back which makes it difficult when traveling because I can only sleep on certain mattresses. Upon arrival, I found the mattress to be a bad fit and informed Agri that I would be checking into a hotel instead, but would not be demanding my money back since the fault is due to my condition. <br/>Instead of letting me walk and keeping my money, Agri suggested I tried a mattress from another room; since we were also the only guests staying with her at the time and to save me from spending extra money for a hotel. Thankfully she had a tempurpedic mattress from another room moved to mine. <br/><br/>Thanks Agri for another great stay! I'll definitely be back the next time I'm in London."

The location is good, 5 minutes do the underground and 30 minutes to the center. The house is cosy, extremely clean and they made me feel at home. As I was working I usually have dinner when I arrive in the evening, so they let me use the kitchen to heat the food. It was very nice of them and helped me a lot. The breakfast is a good ideia, difficult to find a house that serves a breakfast like that.<br/>"

The complementary breakfast was great and well timed; it also allowed us to meet with others that were also staying at the lodge. The lodge was very conveniently located.

42010,124683267,02-01-2017,74064016,Mackenzie,"Agri & Roger are just as lovely as their place. Their home is cosy and welcoming and the two of them are so nice. The breakfast Agri sets up every morning is just like what hotels offer, truly a great breakfast and way to save some money on food. The home is clean and quiet at all times even though there are two rooms rented out. Breakfast is scheduled but it is a nice way to meet the others staying there as well. The location is in zone 3 so it is a bit far from the city center, but the walk to the nearest metro is only 5-8 minutes. The metro is the black - Northern line that leads directly to the city-center which is extremely convenient. Agri will recommend getting an Oyster card for the stay, and it is definitely worth it because you must take the metro to and from the city every day. The card also allows for bus use and it is a great way to save a bunch of money. Overall, the stay was amazing and I would highly recommend Agri & Roger's place if you are okay traveling a bit every morning to the center of the city. "

The breakfast was simple yet they put in extra effort to make sure we enjoy it - I'm lactose intolerant but I see oat milk on the table the next day after Roger knew that I can't take milk.

I had my concerns with the plate routs...it  all depends if you a  nervous person like me  that  suffers  from time to time  difficulties to sleep, specially when is a new bed, bedlinen etc..<br/><br/>Unfortunately it adds as well other factors such  as   <br/>1. The house is close to planes routes to Heathrow which means that is a continuos  noise but it depends of your sensitivity. <br/><br/>2. Other noises within  the house such a loud  TV  the first night until. did not help either.. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the house is not located close to a tube station.<br/><br/>But as I say we had a good stay, and I will recommend people to stay,<br/><br/>Regards,<br/><br/>Lourdes<br/><br/>"

Great location! My girlfriend was a little bit worried because she has really long hair and with only hand lugagge there were no space for the hairdryer. But surprisingly we found it in the room without even ask for it. Sylvan is really a great host, she thinks about everything. You will find everything you need. Recommended!<br/>"

The bathroom was just down the hall which we shared with the other airbnb-ers staying there at the time. Never had a conflict with that though. We were able to take showers when we needed to as everyone else was on their own busy schedules. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Sylvan was a fantastic host and provided us with a map where she showed us the closest buses, metro station, supermarkets, pub, and diners. She even saved us the morning that we left when our Oyster cards didn't have enough money to get us to the airport resulting in us going back to Sylvan's and waking her up to use her telephone to call a cab. Thank you Sylvan!!!!"

Man promenerar in till Fulham centrum på 10 minuter, annars går det bussar. Sylvan är en varm och trevlig värd som hjälper till med det hon vet, om man önskar det. Rummen är mysiga och allting känns fräscht. Runt hörnet finns bästa fish & chips stället.<br/>Det är lätt att ta sig dit från Gatwick och Heathrow. "
43129,22421134,05-11-2014,340958,Marta&Andras,Sylvan's place was ideal for the 3 day conference I attended. She is a very nice person and easy to communicate with. She keeps the house spotless which is located in a quite neighbourhood. Tube is only 15min walk and major attractions are a few stops away. Check in/out was trivial. Fast and working Wifi. Will come back and definitely recommended.

On est un peu loin du Tube mais on peut prendre le bus 211 pour aller à Fulham Broadway et pour les plus sportifs qui n'ont pas peur de rouler à gauche, il y a un parking de Barclays bike tout près. Le fish and ships Baileys vaut vraiment le détour. Le petit chat est adorable. On a juste regretté de ne pas pouvoir utiliser la cuisine de temps en temps. Sylvan est très sympa et vous donnera pleins de conseils sur son quartier.<br/>"
43129,23643612,07-12-2014,23071660,Aurore,"Very quiet neighborhood. Sylvan, despite being very busy, was welcoming and helpful. Small cosy room for 2. We couldn't access the kitchen because of the kitten but we were ok as we were out all day and came back late at night.As for the price: £86 each, you can't beat that for the location, neighborhood and accomodation."

The Twinroom we stayed in was warm and cosy ,but also quite small- I did not mind , but just in case you are a very big person: the beds would be too small... the Hotwaterkettle in the room and tea ,milk and sugar was a very nice surprise, thank you :) . Bath shearing was no problem. Noise from the airport-hm, the planes were very high, so no problem for us... Close to busses to next tube or directly into town-Sylvan will explain: its easy! Enjoy :)"
43129,27617591,08-03-2015,17132281,Paul,"The host Sylvan mad us feel very welcome, and the room was exactly as depicted. The area (Fulham) is quiet pleasant, I recommend a walk through the area and a visit to Bishop's Park (famous from the movie The Omen). Minor drawbacks of the room are the 10 minutes walk to the subway, and the lack of a (small) fridge for drinks/sandwiches. Other than that, everything was perfectly fine, I definitely recommend staying here."

Strongly recommend girls traveling solo to stay with Sylvan. You will feel safe sleeping  in her lovely bedroom. And if you like reading you may pick one of the books from the shelves in your room and read at night. This is exactly what I have done and oh, so many love poem collections! If you have time do have a talk with Sylvan to hear one of her life stories. She is a graceful lady of a distinct character. The sweet liaison with the people of a different culture from yours I suppose is exactly what Airbnb aims for."

Her former life as photographer she could told very interesting about and her two cats were soo cute. I didn't miss a kitchen and didn't bother to share the bathroom (looking around before you visit it) and was happy with the reasonable price per night.

43129,354000212,30-11-2018,193070134,Erick,A lovely room and a confortable bed in well located house (15 minutes walking from Fulham Broadway). Sylvan quickly responded every message and she was very nice during the check in / out process. Highly recommended!

43129,359617339,17-12-2018,45832753,Antoine,"The Fulham area is cozy and convenient, especially if you want to visit west London. You can get anywhere in London from Hammersmith metro station which is next door. Sylvan is very delicate and charming host and I would recommend her place to anybody passing by London."

Lots of coffee shops, pubs and food shops (open late). Sylvan is helpful, welcoming and very warm hostess. Cats were a plus, one of them became a friend who waited for me to cuddle in front of the room. :)"

43129,432262550,03-04-2019,89724497,Valentina,Sylvan è stata fantastica. Ho prenotato la sua piccola e confortevole stanza per mio fratello nel periodo in cui entrambi abbiamo soggiornato a Londra. La stanza è piccola ma davvero graziosa e confortevole. Pulizia perfetta. La casa è in una posizione ottima per raggiungere il centro di Londra.  pochi passi si può trovare la fermata metro di Parsons Green (District Line) ma anche si può raggiungere comodamente Piccadilly con i bus 414 e 14. La consiglio vivamente.
43129,437230036,14-04-2019,84870405,Jorja-Rose,"Excellent place to stay, amazing value as well. Incredibly convenient location with great shops, transport and food nearby on foot but also great connections to public transport to explore London. Loved it!"

Nearby there is a TESCO supermarket to buy everyday things.  The room is nice and comfortable for one or two people.  The owner is very friendly and kind, I recommend you a lot."
43129,507253527,11-08-2019,47594861,Frédérique,I had a very good stay.  I was doing an internship and my school was 8 minutes walk.  Sylvan is a lovely person and you can count on her if you need anything.  I will come back for sure.

43129,593265602,15-01-2020,23694166,Erica,"Very good value for money.  Very comfortable bed, warm house and the room really has all you can possibly need, also unbeatable price for this part of London."

The room was tastefully decorated and very cosy, doted with an extremely comfortable bed. Both the room itself and the bathroom were scrupulously clean. A good location in a quiet, safe area with restaurants and such nearby, and with easy access within a 10 - 15 minute walk to Parson's Green tube station and to bus routes into the centre of town. I highly recommend it."

43129,6.10658E+17,22-04-2022,77849976,Jaeho,Sylvan’s place is very clean. Bedding is really good with a desk good enough to work on a laptop. Neighborhood is very quiet with many good cafes and restaurants. I would highly recommend!

43129,6.36762E+17,28-05-2022,6909818,Mira,"A true gem. I can not recommend Sylvan’s place enough. Location is spot on- very close to public transport, river walk, restaurants, shops- you name it. The room was nicely decore and it felt soo cozy and welcoming. Sylvan is no surprise a super host. I had my flight cancel and then the second re-booked flight got delay with time arriving in London pass midnight. Sylvan was so understanding and waited for my arrival. She truly made sure I’m well set in the room. If I need a place in the London I would come back to Sylvan for sure."

43129,6.58509E+17,27-06-2022,216579190,Hilary,"What a lovely place to stay! The bedroom in Sylvan's house is very comfortable and, together with the bathroom, spotlessly clean.  We were made very welcome by Sylvan and all the arrangements went very smoothly.  Sylvan's house is in Fulham which is a lovely, quiet and ""village-like"" part of London to stay in, but it is also very well placed for accessing all the attractions of central London. I thoroughly recommend Sylvan's lovely accommodation and the interesting stories she can tell you about James Bond and Bob Dylan!!"
43129,6.60651E+17,30-06-2022,53235724,Harry,A great place to stay in London. Great room and check in was very easy! Thanks a bunch.

Its fairly easy to catch a bus og Underground train nearby. the flat I cosy and the bed comfy. Sylvan was very helpful with all our questions. Highly recommended."

43129,7.57062E+17,10-11-2022,307348108,Antonio,"Es un alojamiento confortable, solo cuenta con un baño, sería genial establecer un horario para poder reservar y prever tiempos.  El tiempo que se hace al metro es aproximadamente 20 minutos caminando, igual en transporte público. La zona es muy segura. Estaría bien establecer un espacio para poder lavar alguna taza o un vaso, ya que no se puede utilizar la cocina."

Sylvan, the host/owner was very warm and friendly, just like her home 😀<br/>My bedroom was clean as a whistle and decorated beautifully. Everything I needed was in my room ie. kettle, cutlery, good cupboard space and a TV with loads of channels. The bathroom was right next door to my room and was spotless with the best hot water and pressure I've encountered anywhere in the UK! So, it was pure bliss to have a hot shower every evening (or bath). The bnb is really close to the main road where bus stops are close by as well as a Tesco's Express and some lovely pubs. I would definitely stay there again without any hesitation. Thanks Sylvan! xx"
43129,7.80976E+17,13-12-2022,12977251,Francesco,"In London for work and we stayed at Sylvan's place for 4 nights. Great location, lovely house (super warm in these cold days!) and Sylvan was a wonderful host. Definitely recommended. Thanks!"

43129,9.13688E+17,14-06-2023,514555591,Caoimhe,"Sylvan was a friendly and very considerate host. The bedroom was clean and tidy. The bed was also comfortable. There were tea making facilities, however, since the weather was so hot a mini fridge would've been ideal. The bathroom was pristine and the shower was fantastic. Nice little area and shops are within walking distance.  I will definitely stay here again if I return to London. Thanks Sylvan! :)"
43129,9.2084E+17,24-06-2023,179140256,Paul,Enjoyable stay. If you’re staying more than a few days you may want to consider a place with full kitchen access.
43129,9.26632E+17,02-07-2023,32515834,Graham,"Unfortunately Sylvan was busy when we arrived 10 minutes early so the welcome and introduction was very brief and poor, although in fairness Sylvan did apologise later in the evening.<br/>It is a lovely house in a beautiful area, the photos are accurate, but in my opinion the room could do with a bit of TLC."
43129,9.33188E+17,11-07-2023,46148867,Deb,"my stay was brief, four nights. unfortunately for me I stayed in on the Saturday night and had the misfortune to have to listen to badly sung karaoke from the local pubs behind the house. but it stopped by 11. and this by no means a reflection of my stay. normally I would be out and about so it didn't bother me. as someone previously stated a small fridge would have been ideal. again I ate out mostly. the room was clean and tidy.the bed was comfortable but was very creaky when you moved and the small fan was very much appreciated in high temperatures. easy access to buses to the trains."
43129,9.62965E+17,21-08-2023,165029764,Joel,Clean room in a nice quiet area

43202,1918249,07-08-2012,2444776,Mike,"What a great, stylish little apartment! You'll struggle to find a view like this anywhere else in London. From the balcony we were able to see right across the city and took some fantastic photographs of the moon sitting majestically behind The Shard.<br/><br/>Great travel links from Kensal Green, Kensal Rise and Queens park and an array of wonderful bars and restaurants just a stone's throw away, as well as a handy little Tesco supermarket and Nandos a minutes walk around the corner.<br/><br/>Calpyso was a pleasure to deal with and I would certainly stay here again.<br/><br/>"
43202,5295821,23-06-2013,1808778,Denise,"I've spent a great week at Calypso's place. The photos here on airbnb give a very good impression of the apartment. <br/><br/>I loved the big bathroom and the floor-to-ceiling windows/balcony doors that flood the place with light.<br/><br/>The kitchen has everything you might possibly need during your stay in London.<br/><br/>However, the very best thing about Calypso's place is the balcony. Even though the weather wasn't that great I spent a lot of time out there.<br/><br/>Would definitely stay here again if the apartment is available!"
43202,11699545,12-04-2014,9305390,Neil,"I stay in London at least 2 weeks a month, and this is the best flat I have stayed in, it's very stylish without trying too hard, great books on the shelves and some quirky lighting combos (best if you find these yourself!) High ceilings and windows to match the height meant I pretty much spent most of my time on that sofa you can see, bathed in light.  Calypso was a great host, a fellow cyclist (nice safe place for cycle storage outside) and was easily accessible by phone throughout my week, can't wait for this place to be available for me again, a definite 5 stars from me"
43202,11728710,13-04-2014,6269550,Himat,"Really cool place. Great views of London from Calypso's really cool balcony.<br/><br/>Clean, spacious, stylish and fun.<br/><br/>Thanks Calypso for a great stay!<br/><br/>Highly recommended! "
43202,11784959,14-04-2014,14129937,Emma,"This was a wonderful apartment to stay in for my weekend in London having come up from Somerset. Calypso was very friendly and instantly made me feel welcome and at home. The apartment is a 5 minute walk from Queens Park tube and a ten minute walk to Portabello Market with a fantastic private balcony view of central London. I just needed a base for the night but as soon as I got there I wish I hadn't made as many plans to go out and do other things as I just wanted to sit on the balcony, read and watch the world go by. As with any place in London there is a low hum of traffic during the night but the double glazing effectively keeps most of that sound out. It's bright, modern and positive space which has won me over to using airbnb for the future. Hopefully I'll be able to stay here again. "
43202,11976627,20-04-2014,6635649,Shane,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Calypso's beautiful apartment. A great location, handy parking, wonderful views, dawn chorus of birds each morning. Even watering the plants made it feel more homey. Highly recommend."

43202,12247556,27-04-2014,1857388,Garazi,"Calypso's flat is the best option to stay in London. The apartment is perfectly located: it is only 5minutes walking from Kensal green tube and overground station. The Bakerloo line  will transport you to Piccadilly circus in less than 20 minutes. <br/>The flat has a great view and the neighborhood is really pleasant and quiet.we highly recommend Calypso's apartment. She is really kind and makes you feel at home. "
43202,16534210,28-07-2014,8269486,Justine,Calypso is a wonderful host. We were (almost) sorry she had to leave !
43202,17980397,19-08-2014,19859217,Janis,"Calypso was very welcoming and had clearly taken trouble to make the apartment feel like home.  Visitors will find they have everything that they need - lots of towels, wifi, barbeque on the balcony, iPod dock - the list is endless.  The standard of equipment is good, the bed comfortable and the place is very clean and tidy.  As others have said, the view across London to The Shard is amazing - I was lucky to have good weather and sat out in the evenings.  Local facilities are good with a small Tesco and a wide variety of restaurants and pubs within a 5 - 10 minute walk.  I stayed three nights and felt very much at home.  Thank you, Calypso. "
43202,18911828,02-09-2014,4270739,Kamal,"To meet Calypso and stay at her apartment was a truly delightful experience. The place is warm, comfortable, clean and bright, decorated with taste. You feel at home immediately. Plus the balcony, if the weather allows it, gives you this opportunity to gaze at the horizon and really extend the sense of space that this place offers.<br/>Calypso was very arranging at meeting us earlier because of our schedule, communication was very good, and there's also this feeling of trust that is priceless. <br/>This is a great place to stay."
43202,19131322,07-09-2014,18391985,Melissa,"Calypso was very helpful telling us how to get there and responsive while we were there. The flat is big, more than enough room for my husband and I. The balcony doors were really nice to leave open.  All the necessities were there, dishes, tp, shampoo etc..   <br/>The bus is straight across the street so that was a nice way to get around. The metro is about a 10 min walk.  The supermarket around the corner was very convenient. <br/>The only thing we didn't like is that it smelled bad, the bathroom had a sewage smell, while not super strong it was enough to be unpleasant.  The bathroom also didn't feel very clean.<br/>Overall the experience was great and I think you would enjoy staying there! "
43202,24650556,01-01-2015,23264883,Steve,"Great location. Public transportation was close and easily accessible. Neighborhood was not loaded with tourists, which was a huge plus.  Apartment is comfortable with just a great view. "
43202,26270504,08-02-2015,25801484,Maximilian,"The flat instantly feels like home, even though you've just arrived. Everything's where it should be and you can simply relax after spending the day exploring London. The view from the balcony is simply amazing.<br/><br/>Great restaurants, a supermarket and - if you're into it - a pub right around the corner, bus stops in-front of the house, and an underground station within walking distance.<br/><br/>Calypso was a wonderful host and I'll definitely try and book the flat again the next time I'm planning a trip to London."

Very precise for the instructions concerning the apartment at our arrival.<br/>The neighborhood is very close to notting hill. <br/>The apartment is REALLY nice, clean and very comfortable.<br/>I would strongly suggest this place if you are planning to spend your holidays in west London."
43202,32208245,15-05-2015,20782306,Lisa,"<br/>Calypso made me feel welcome from the moment I got my first email from her. I stayed in her apartment for 5 nights enjoying a comfortable homely environment, surrounded by greenery and loads of natural light. The view was amazing looking over the city of London skyline and terraced rooftops like a scene from Mary Poppins. <br/>Before my arrival I was sent very detailed instructions on how to get into the complex and soon after arrival a personal phone call to check that everything was OK. <br/>I loved exploring London during the day and to come home to Calypsos place at night and cook my own meal was perfect.<br/>With such short notice in my booking I want to say thank you Calypso for opening your home up to me."
43202,33196320,25-05-2015,3714769,Lisa,"Calypso made me feel extremely welcome into her lovely home. The description list and the photos matched exactly and the neighbours were all very friendly, the area was nice and quiet. "
43202,34100395,04-06-2015,2699579,Marcus,"As described ! Everything was great and along Calypso's communication. I'd previously lived in London for 20 years, so I'm not coming from a tourist perspective but for downtime in between work so, for a very relaxing place, comfortable and easy transport links you can't go wrong. Shame I didn't have more time to sit longer on the balcony and soak up the sunshine, plants and my breakfast! I would certainly recommend Calypso's place because it looks like a home with feeling rather than other Airbnb listings that are generic and basically sold as hotel like rooms. Thanks Calypso and hope you had a great holiday. M."
43202,34562466,09-06-2015,33739869,Ray,"We enjoyed our stay at Calypso's flat, exploring London from there and eating at the local Indian restaurants!  The neighborhood is nice, and affords easy access to central London via 2 tube stops within a short walk.  We had everything we needed there to make our stay a pleasant one."
43202,36488514,28-06-2015,2157755,Lime Street,"Calypso is an amazing hosts. She replied to us within seconds, agreed to host us very last minute and was super friendly!

Calypso svarede nærmest øjeblikkeligt på alt og var meget opmærksom på at alt var i orden. Området har et par glimrende restauranter, og lige foran døren kører bus direkte ind midt i byen."
43202,40026194,27-07-2015,174802,Bruce,"Calypso is a great host. Prompt and easy communication. Her apartment is wonderful, exactly like the pics. Incredible view over London, great on cloudy and rainy days. Top floor and no neighbors to speak of, so nice and quiet. Also, Kensal Rise is a real London neighborhood. Tesco downstairs, good sushi take-out at Hana and a quick 15 minute walk to Portobello Road. There's a bus stop right outside the apartment and the Queen's Park tube station is 10 minutes away by foot. I stayed a week; needed to stay an extra day and Calypso graciously offered me her flat for the extra day, even though she was just back from her holiday. All in all, a fantastic AirBnb experience."

On arrival we were shown around, even a cup of tea ready & waiting on a very rainy day. Her home is in a good location & has everything you could want for a stay in London. Having a balcony was a great way to relax & watch the world go by. <br/>We really enjoyed our stay & meeting calypso, I would highly recommend booking this apartment."

43202,52944662,02-11-2015,6006231,Khai,"Calypso was a very welcoming host and her replies were always very prompt. As for the flat, it was beautifully decorated, had all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay and it's well connected to central London with a bus stop just a few steps away and the tube about 5 minutes walk. It's quite centrally located in London and there are loads of shops near the apartment. Overall a great place to stay. "

43202,57286506,24-12-2015,10984035,Marianne,Calypso is the perfect host. She gave us many good tips. The flat is perfect. Very nice. With the bus Nr. 6 you get easy to the city and you also can enjoy a lovely sightseeing. I highly recommend the flat. Thank you for everything.
43202,58002160,31-12-2015,45148076,Nick,"Absolutely wonderful experience.  Calypso was a great host; excellent communication before and during the visit.  Also, because we arrived into London on XMAS day when all grocery stores (and most restaurants) are closed, Calypso kindly offered to purchase some groceries for us (and even included some special XMAS treats!).   The apartment is really nice (as pictured)- loved the high ceilings, tasteful decor/furnishings, and view from the large windows.  Location was very good; grocery store and restaurants are right around the corner, Queens Park tube stop is about 10 min walk away.  We enjoyed the walk, but it was nice to know that the walk could be avoided by taking the bus that stops right in front of the apartment.   We'd highly recommend staying here.   "
43202,58294055,02-01-2016,46229334,Ed,"Calypso has a truly wonderful apartment in a lovely residential corner of London. Its incredibly close to transport links, and is only a short tube ride away from the city centre.<br/>Calypso's communication throughout the whole process was fast and helpful, and her reception at the flat was warm and welcoming.<br/>Overall, we had a wonderful time, and wouldn't hesitate to book again."

She was extremely accommodating, from offering a very appreciated cup of tea on arriving to recommending excellent local restaurants. The flat is really lovely, and has everything you need to feel at home. This was the first time I had used Airbnb, and it couldn't have been easier or better - thank you! "

43202,80871711,20-06-2016,58227835,Annalisa,"Calypso's flat was great and she is a gracious and accommodating hostess!  Very eclectic and lovely decor, awesome floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of the neighborhood as well as the London skyline in the distance, and her home was clean and safe.  We had odd arrival and departure times and Calypso was great in accommodating that, even at the last minute.  Neighborhood is lively with bars, grocery, etc. nearby and bus lines are right outside the building with reasonable distances to the Tube.  Overall, I'd recommend the flat, with an even stronger recommendation for Calypso as a hostess."
43202,86085169,14-07-2016,68909468,Shirin,"Calypso's flat was beautiful and in a very nice location.

I have tried to book again end of August, but unfortunately this little gem is not available!<br/>Thank you for the wonderful experience Calypso"
43202,87833327,22-07-2016,64968087,Patricia,Unfortunately we could not enjoy our stay at Calypso's apartment as the noise and vibration from the construction site was so bad it caused glasses and crockery to shake in our kitchen. It was also extremely hot during our midweek stay. Calyspo was there to welcome us and responded quickly to questions we had during our stay eg how to get sound on TV. Bus stop is right outside the building. 
43202,88783056,25-07-2016,13513420,Tariq,"Although we didn't meet her, Calypso was very helpful and accommodating.    The apartment is beautiful and in an interesting part of London, close enough to everything you need to get to.  <br/><br/>It was unusually hot in London when we stayed and the only drawback with the apartment was that it also got very hot with limited means to cool it. <br/><br/>Overall a wonderful stay. "
43202,90676341,01-08-2016,3274600,Matthias,I really enjoyed staying at Calypso's crib. Though I didn't her she welcomed me on point via messages on my arrival and made sure that I feel welcome. Though there was scaffolding in front of the building during my stay the views were still breathtaking. Her apartment is a gem and I'd recommend it to my friends.
43202,92120258,07-08-2016,30924896,Brian,"Calypso's place is perfect for anyone seeking a non-touristy glimpse of London.  That's to say you have access to a great part of town and get to feel like a local.  Easy access to the tube, great restaurants, a grocery store almost right next door for you chefs reading this.  The apartment couldn't be cleaner, and calypso really appreciates a good visitor.  Highly recommended."
43202,121209055,15-12-2016,83628616,Nathan,"Great apartment right next to public transport, but a bit far so get an Oyster card. There was a miscommunication with our arrival time, but the hostess more than made up for it by treating us to breakfast at a great restaurant. Great place to stay!<br/>"

The place is impeccably decorated and has a very nice deck with an amazing view of the city, not to mention the bed is immensely comfy! Calypso was an amazing host and extremely communicative. We were staying in her place during the attack in London and she made sure we were safe. We told her we were planning on making dinner and staying in and she gave us great recommendations and wanted us to use whatever we needed. It was a little farther from the city then we originally expected, but in the end we loved being a little further away from everything. All around we were very happy at Calypso's place!"

43202,175256711,28-07-2017,27698330,Nancy,"Beautiful, comfortable space - easy to get to/from the center of town and the airports. Current construction across the street wasn't a problem - they don't seem to start working until at least 8 - maybe more like 9 a.m."

We were incredibly lucky with the weather and sitting on her balcony with a cup of tea in the sun is a great start into the day. The flat is very close to all amenities and bus stops which take you straight to notring hill and there are some nice little cafes around. Communication was superb and Calypso is a great host. Even if she wasn't there personally. <br/>I would stay there again any time and cam highly recommend it.
43202,201919166,09-10-2017,153106517,Michael,Really nice flat and great host. Bus or tunnel to Central London allowed us to see the sites in a few days. Bars and local restaurants to relax at when your done

43202,238215749,25-02-2018,14097661,Sohail,"While I was staying at this stylishly well-decorated place, I couldn't stop asking myself if Calypso is an architect or interior designer! But, what I had no doubt about was that she is a well-travelled explorer with a great sense of style and choice of colours. I myself am a hobbyist photographer, obsessed with colours, and a passionate world explorer. So, Calypso's artistic and super clean place was very inspiring and mind refreshing for me in addition to being close to bus stops, Tesco Express, a cash machine and a number of restaurants.<br/>I hope to see Calypso and her boyfriend again.

43202,239812751,03-03-2018,30949065,Tom,"First of all: Calypso is a great host! She has a very good taste and so her apartment is stylish. It is quiet, has a nice balcony (which I can’t use because of the winter weather in London during my stay) and is well located (many busses and fast access to the Tube (just two bus stations)). Calypso gave me a warm welcome on arrival. And bagles with jam :-D She answered all questions during my time in London instantly. She also gave me good hints to choose activities.<br/>So I highly recommend the apartment!"

You have a nice balcony with great view of London.<br/>There is still a construction site just across the appartement but it wasn’t an issue during my stay. <br/>Only downside, the area itself isn’t fantastic but  you’re  fairly close to 2 tube stations and plenty of buses just on the street."

Erg gezellig appartement waar je je gemakkelijk thuis voelt. Mooie lichte ruimte, sfeervolle inrichting en fijn balkon. Rustig gelegen en fijne slaapkamer zorgde bij ons voor een goede nachtrust. <br/> Supermarkt en bus naar Notting Hill en Hyde Park vlak om de hoek was erg handig. Afstand naar dichtstbijzijnde metro kleine 10 minuten lopen was ook goed te doen. Zeker een aanrader, dit appartement is een fijn rustpunt in deze bruisende stad."

We were just far enough away to not be in the middle of tourists, but quickly able to get to areas like Hyde Park within minutes. There are bus stations located outside and train stations available nearby as well. Calypso is very hospitable and was available to help whenever we had questions. Would definitely recommend."
43202,436480417,13-04-2019,198738442,Rochelle,"This is a great location near bus and train stops, quiet in the evenings, very stylishly decorated, and overall a great place to stay. Check in was very easy and Calypso was in touch throughout via messages, but not overly intrusive. I would recommend this flat to anyone wanting a safe place to stay in London."

Stylish interiour, all amenities that are needed for a great stay and last but not least a very friendly and helpful lady as host. <br/>If you plan a stay in London this is the place to be. Bus in front of the house and the tube 10 min away by foot gets you quickly in the city center. Store in walking distance and restaurants nearby."

43202,587643085,03-01-2020,151908711,Bethany,"Calypso’s place is the perfect spot for the design-conscious traveler, seeking comfort outside of the madness of the city center. Her apartment is beautifully decorated, and since I was there over the holidays, she’d put up a lovely Christmas tree for me to enjoy. It was a beautiful place to wake up every morning and come home to after exploring around town every day. She checked in with me frequently to ensure I was comfortable, enjoying myself and if I needed anything. It was a wonderful place to stay and I will surely be back."
43202,615642035,08-03-2020,36662646,Catherine,"Calypso's apartment is  stylish, impeccably clean and well situated.  Public transport is just outside and Queens Park very close by. It was very convenient for me as I was visiting my daughter who was an 8 minute walk away.  It's located in a handsome modern building with a central courtyard. Calypso responded quickly to answer any questions I might have.<br/>I highly recommend this beautiful homey flat.  Thank you Calypso."
43202,660201025,04-09-2020,12187671,Cliff,"I stayed at Calypso’s home for 2 weeks and it was the perfect place for exploring London. It’s located on the top floor of a stylish block of apartments and the view of the city from the balcony is stunning. Several grocery stores are within minutes and it’s close to many restaurants. I felt like I was in a good friend’s home, and Calypso was readily available for any needs I had. I recommend!"
43202,700540023,15-10-2020,13272075,Jude,"We had such a wonderful stay in Calypso’s place. She was such a great host and made us feel comfortable from the moment we arrived. Every step of our stay Calypso was available to help with any issues we had big or small, and made sure that we had everything we need to feel at home. Highly recommend staying here!"
43202,721432803,03-01-2021,186148,Tanja,"What a place and what incredible hosts! It has been our best experience in Airbnb ever! <br/>Calypso and Claudio are outstanding hosts: attentive, subtle, generous, discrete and extremely accommodative. We landed the day the tier 4  lockdown was imposed and not only felt that we had a real home in London but also that we had a family here. <br/>The place is way better than the pics: it's cozy, very aesthetic and fully equipped for all your needs. I brought <br/> the spices with me but the place had more than any professional kitchen. And we were kindly invited to use them, thank you so much! <br/>The neighbourhood is cool, even for a lockdown, with many shops, coffee places, parks etc. An amazing farmers market recommended by our hosts - do visit it! <br/>Overall, we could not wish any better stay and will absolutely come back here! Thank you again, Calypso and Claudio!"
43202,736660357,06-03-2021,19613943,Eimear,"The apartment is a beautiful, inspiring space and very well equipped for a longer stay. We appreciated the remote working space, fantastically resourced kitchen and personal touches around the comfortable living area.<br/>Calypso and Claudio are kind and thoughtful hosts who were easy to reach throughout our stay. Their neighbour, Carl, made checkin a breeze.<br/>The city view from the big windows and balcony is lovely. The bedroom’s quiet, clean and comfortable, with wardrobe space available. Thanks for having us!"

43202,4.86799E+17,02-11-2021,123527675,Kwanza,"Calypso's place was just as pictured and perfect for our short stay! It's conveniently located with easy access to public transportation and many shops and restaurants in a short walking distance. I loved the decor, the long balcony, high ceilings, and the large floor to ceiling windows. Calypso was very sweet, communicative, and readily available to help out with any issues. Would definitely recommend :)"
43202,5.96945E+17,03-04-2022,70992087,Katherine,"Calypso’s place is not only stunning, but it’s welcoming and the perfect central location for getting around the city. She and Claudio were easily accessible, beyond kind, and had great suggestions around the neighborhood. If you’re a solo traveler, this is a safe and secure spot. Public transport is right out front or just a few minutes walk. There are a couple of local groceries stores near by, but the Sunday local Farmer’s Market was a special treat. I will definitely stay here again my next trip out!"
43202,6.01322E+17,09-04-2022,2469502,Mete,"Calypso and Claudio are amazing hosts. From our check-in to check-out, they were very helpful.<br/>The house is exactly how it is advertised. When the weather is nice, the balcony is very enjoyable.<br/>The location of the house is great. It is close to underground and overground. There are nice coffee shops in 5 minutes distance.<br/>Thank you very much Calypso and Claudio, hoping to stay at your place in the future!"

All the amenities you need, vinyl record player, and a top floor balcony. We got to meet and she was so lovely and welcoming to me! Loved my stay."
43202,6.39651E+17,01-06-2022,166213393,Aly,Calypso and Claudio are great hosts! Their place is absolutely lovely. The location is great. They’re very responsive and supporting. 5 stars to them!
43202,6.54851E+17,22-06-2022,48960143,Donna,"Calypso's apartment is fabulous. Quirky by design, plenty of room, very comfy bed and a great location from which to explore London.<br/>We stayed during the rail strike but it hardly bothered us as there are bus stops literally everywhere.<br/>It's a lovely stroll to Notting Hill and Portobello Road. There are cafes and supermarkets just a few steps away.<br/>There is some road noise as the street below is quite busy and we had to keep the doors open as we had some very warm days. <br/>But it wasn't a big issue and we highly recommend Calypso's place. It has everything you could possibly need for a stay in London. <br/>Calypso is an amazing host - she really wants her guests to enjoy their stay in her apartment. A big thank you to her neighbor Carl who facilitated our check in which became messy due to flight delays and cancellations.<br/>Thanks so much for making check in and check out so easy. Communication was phenomenal 😊"
43202,6.59949E+17,29-06-2022,218437223,Molly,The apartment looks exactly the same as the pictures show on the platform. The host and the neighbour were very responsive and friendly! Had a really lovely stay:)
43202,6.64357E+17,05-07-2022,4955626,Gabriel,"Calypso’s place was that perfect AirBnB experience : a really special space with a stunning view of London and a comfortable, funky and fun vibe that was both unique and at the same time easy to use. We made good use of the local buses, restaurants and the nearby Tube stop, which made it a great base to explore London. Portobello Road was easy to access, just a long walk or a short bus ride away. Outdoor space and sun, and a sense of privacy too. We loved it and highly recommend it for a couple or anyone looking for a lovely little nest above London!"
43202,6.7154E+17,15-07-2022,23222610,Udo,The apartment was really great and we enjoyed the time in London. Everything was managed perfectly by Calypso and her neighbor Carl. We cycled every day from the apartment to the hot spots in London center. There are quit safe and convenient cycle routes.
43202,6.74495E+17,19-07-2022,339191042,Smrithi,"My partner and I stayed at Calypso and Claudio's place and had an absolutely wonderful time. Their place was filled with beautifully curated artwork, decor, and furniture. Their place is just as pictured (in fact I think the pictures don't do justice to what it looks like in person.) The apartment was tidy, well kept, and had everything to meet our basic needs (clean towels, sheets, shampoo, etc.)  Not to mention the beautiful view of the London skyline from the balcony. This was the perfect amount of our space for me and my partner who ended up staying inside most of our trip due to the heatwave all of the U.K was experiencing. There is a Nando's and Tesco grocery store right downstairs which is super convenient. The main road is filled with many bars, restaurants, and shops, with the Queen Parks tube station only a few minutes away. I mainly communicated with Calypso during our stay and she was extremely kind and responsive to our needs. 10/10 experience!!"
43202,7.43258E+17,22-10-2022,17525623,Atika,"My partner and I stayed at Calypso’s beautiful house for 4 days. The check in & out process was smooth and easy. Theres literally a bus stop right below the airbnb, and a tube station around 10 mins walk. Many food around and theres even a Tesco express downstair. It’s slightly far from the city centre via public transport, about 30-40 mins train ride but it is so so worth it!! Uber to Soho is fairly cheap (we paid less than 15 GBP one way)<br/>The airbnb is exactly like the photos. Beautiful and well curated with personal touch as it is their beautiful home. Calypso was kind and ensure we were okay throughout our whole stay. My partner and I really love the airbnb and we will definitely be back if we’re ever in London again xx"

It was exciting to watch the New Year’s Eve fireworks on the balcony from a distance. Host is very welcoming and helpful, which makes the stay even more pleasant!"
43202,9.37556E+17,17-07-2023,8591513,Klaus,Calypso was a really nice host and the apartment is beautiful and cozy.

The host also made sure I was settled in and gave recommendations for the area. The apartment was tidy, clean, and had a lot of character. I loved being able to stay there!"

Calypso herself is a very friendly and welcoming person; I'm really glad I met her. Overall amazing experience; would highly recommend!"

45168,96378,13-09-2010,174903,Tony,"I can't say enough good things about this apartment and my dealings with Lina.<br/><br/>We are in London on a multi-year transfer from the U.S. (Boston) and had been staying in corporate apartments (soul-sucking Chelsea Cloisters), and when our time ran out there we were still a week away from being able to move in to our new place. CC wouldn't let us extend, but we hated it there anyway and I found Lina's place and sent a note.<br/><br/>Even though she was traveling at the time, she was very prompt, which was awesome because we were in such urgent need of settled accommodations because my wife and I have an infant son. The whole week we were there she was always available via email or phone.<br/><br/>And we couldn't have asked for a better host. It felt like staying at a friend's place. The apartment is small but very (VERY) well-organized and clean, with lots of interesting art and books and a great kitchen. (She has an induction stovetop, which is awesome... read the instructions if you've never used one). She has flowers at all the windows and she's top floor so there's always a nice breeze blowing through.<br/><br/>Having an outfitted apartment was so much better than the corporate thing. Just having the cookware and the spices and such. She also had a Bose speaker for iPods/iPhones which was a nice treat.<br/><br/>The location is also fantastic. Close to Portabello Road and lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance. She will give you recommendations if you ask.<br/><br/>Obviously, we loved it. Feel free to contact me with questions, but I whole-heartedly recommend this place."
45168,107614,28-09-2010,231079,Joo Yeon,"I have travelled to London many times in the past twenty years, and I can confidently say that staying at Lina’s flat was one of the best experiences I have had in London. I am so glad I made a decision to stay at her flat instead of going to a hotel. The flat is a hidden treasure - in fact, Lina is a hidden treasure. She treated me as one of her closest friends - she was whole time responsive and attentive to my needs. Lina is a very caring and generous person who loves collecting and making ceramics, reading poems, eating organic foods, watering plants and flowers, most of all, sharing her life with people. Her flat is a small gallery filled with colourful and joyful objects, prints and furniture. The flat is conveniently located in trendy Notting Hill area, close to all amenities. I feel very lucky to have stayed at Lina’s flat. She is simply too good to be true."
45168,113147,06-10-2010,243147,Elizabeth,"We couldn't have asked for a better stay - Lina's apartment is beautifully decorated and full of interesting books and art, and it's impeccably clean and well-organised. The wonderful red kitchen is completely kitted out - we had friends over to brunch - and the little touches, like flowerboxes in the windows, make the whole place feel like an oasis.<br/>Lina herself was a wonderful, warm hostess - we had a very late arrival and she met us at the apartment at 11:30pm with a smile. She was full of good advice about the neighbourhood - which is charming and felt very safe - and was flexible about a checkout time (""it's not a hotel"", she told me). Truly, as the ad says, a home from home. "
45168,122650,19-10-2010,249840,Charles,"I was in London for a few nights to attend a conference and the hotel it was held at was prohibitively expensive. This is what originally lead me to find AirBnB and Lina's flat was the first reservation I made. Boy was it a good choice. <br/><br/>Her flat is really quite lovely. It's sort of like staying in one of those little demo apartments Ikea builds in their stores and labels something like ""A whole apartment in 500 square feet!"". Except Lina has much better art and a heck of a lot more books.<br/><br/>That's not to say the apartment is small. It's a real one bedroom with a nice little kitchen and a good sized living room. The bedroom is cozy and the bed is quite comfortable. <br/><br/>Lina was a fantastic host. Before my arrival she coordinated with me and arranged for a taxi to pick me up at the airport. The night I arrived she took me out for a stroll to show me around the neighborhood and gave me plenty of advice on what to do, where to eat and how to get around. Way better than any hotel concierge. <br/><br/>To be honest, the London leg of my trip was the one I was least looking forward to but thanks to Lina I had a delightful time.<br/> "
45168,123303,20-10-2010,110496,Kristine,"Lina's apartment is charming - as is the neighborhood! Making the arrangements with Lina was straightforward, and she was incredibly accommodating about our nebulous arrival time.<br/><br/>We look forward to staying here again - and to seeing Lina again."
45168,124535,22-10-2010,245779,Cornelia,"We enjoyed our stay in Lina’s flat very much. She provided us with everything from toaster to hair dryer and she even had some useful tips for London and the Portobello area. Furthermore, she was always able to be reached when we needed her. The appartment was very clean :)<br/>We were comfortable and felt very much at home! Thanks a lot!<br/><br/>"
45168,131617,01-11-2010,270086,Chad,"Truly a home away from home. Lina's apartment is a perfect combination of sophistication, comfort, and utility. Lina went the extra mile to ensure that my stay was absolutely stress free. A perfect neighborhood, amazingly comfortable bed, espresso machine, printer, fine chocolate, and croissants... <br/><br/>"
45168,134145,06-11-2010,240360,Marlaine,"Lina is a lovely, very likable, accessible, and generous host. Her apartment is equally lovely, filled with her beautiful ceramics, and very well located: a couple of minutes from Portobello Road and its market; close to sundries, several buses, fun shops, and great restaurants; and a ten-minute walk from two train lines. We felt completely at home and would love to stay there again on our next trip to London. "
45168,152952,13-12-2010,236214,Tina,Lina's place was perfect for our weekend in London. It is full of interesting and eclectic touches and in a fantastic neighborhood. Lina made us feel very welcome and at home -- she even left us croissants for the morning. I can't recommend her apartment highly enough -- we would love to stay at her place again!
45168,164510,03-01-2011,86034,Alexander,"The appartement is located in a really nice part of town, with nice shops and bars at walking distance. The appartement itself is really nice, clean, and incredibly well organized and decorated. Thank you!"
45168,170953,16-01-2011,212557,Forrest,"Lina is a congenial and gracious host. We enjoyed getting to know her.<br/><br/>The flat is in a very quiet residential area with convenient Tube and bus connections nearby.  It is walking distance to a lively neighborhood with many excellent dining options, pharmacies and grocery stores. <br/><br/>Everything in the flat works and is exactly as described. It's a very comfortable place to return after a day out and feels like home with all the personal touches and warmth of staying at a friend's house.  Lina went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  She left excellent instructions, welcomed us with croissants and breakfast items, and was available by phone and email during our stay.  She gave us advice about getting to Gatwick for our departing flight and even offered to help us book a taxi if we needed one.  <br/><br/>I recommend this flat and the host without reserve and will be coming back in the spring to stay at Lina's again."
45168,195921,10-03-2011,368878,Zak,Lina was a great host! The apartment was as advertised and the neighborhood is absolutely splendid. I quickly became a local at the little coffee shop across the street. I definitely recommend this place and would stay again anytime. Thanks Lina!
45168,216092,03-04-2011,447286,Kishan,An amazing apartment in a perfect location! I used Lina's place to propose to my girlfriend because it seemed like such a homely place and I wasn't wrong! And Lina is so helpful and flexible - it was a great experience from start to finish.
45168,221016,09-04-2011,106120,Elisa And Julien,"In Lina's kitchen, there is a glass shelf above eye level.  On it, there are about 50 Illy coffee cans.  Under each can is a label for its content: nuts, teas, spices.  One can see these labels by looking through the glass shelf.  This is a very smart organization, and a representative of how tastefully the apartment is organized and decorated.  Fun artwork on the wall, as well as interesting ceramics on shelves, like a ""mug for masochists"" (with teeth around its rim).  Interesting books placed on a snaking shelf.  Some of it was made by Lina herself.  The bed is comfortable and the apartment has a lot of light.  The kitchen is well-equipped: in particular, excellent quality pots and pans.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is perfect: very quiet, yet a few blocks from Portobello road, where one can find numerous restaurants, a marker and a flea market.  One can also walk in fifteen minutes to Hyde Park.<br/><br/>Lina greeted us when we arrived, gave us a tour of the apartment.  She responded fast when we had questions during our stay."
45168,240270,26-04-2011,355622,Cami,"We (family of four) had a wonderful week long stay at Lina's flat.  We greatly enjoyed knowing that we had such a comfortable ""home"" to come back to after a long day of exploring the city.  The flat offers some nice amenities such as a hair dryer, washer/dryer, espresso machine, dish washer, and travel sized shampoo and conditioner.  The bed was very comfortable.  We loved the neighborhood and really liked that it was conveniently located near tube and bus stops.  Lina sent very helpful, detailed information about the flat prior to our arrival.  Staying at Lina's flat was a great initiation into the airbn experience.  "
45168,350142,03-07-2011,164803,Arnel,"Lina's flat in Notting Hill was perfect for our stay. Cozy and very well kept home with all the essentials one needs for a brief stay in London. A wide variety of restaurants and shops are only a 5 minute walk away (Portobello St) and certainly should satisfy anyone's taste or appetite. Lina is a lovely host and provided all the information we needed for the flat and area to make our stay as comfortable as possible. As a coffee drinker, the espresso machine in her kitchen was an addictive plus! Lina also left Oyster cards and London's ""Best of"" books for those wanting to explore the city. A definite repeat stay if it's available on the next trip to London town!"
45168,356977,06-07-2011,688391,Marina,"We stayed at Lina's for three days with our toddler. We really enjoyed the location, so close to everything central! we had great walks around the town. Eventhough we had oyster cards with us, we only used them once and only because we did not realize how close we are to everything..<br/>The flat was just the right size for the three of us. One could really see it is a home for the host and we felt comfortable and welcomed there!<br/>Thank you, Lina, for meeting with us, we loved your company!"
45168,425674,07-08-2011,694645,Jess,"Great location, loved being able to go down the road to the markets. Lina was great, made us feel very welcome ( even left us fresh fruit ) and was fantastic to deal with.<br/>"
45168,485668,29-08-2011,846395,Victor,"Thank you so much Lina for sharing your home with me .<br/><br/>I had a fantastic stay at Lina`s Flat and it brought back many memories as I lived in the same area in the late 80`s . <br/><br/>I could not have been happier with the experience . Whilst Lina was away on a trip she was in constant communication and helped me sort out all of my needs . Her flat has everything that you could need .<br/><br/>The flat is in a great area and close to the Underground,Buses and many great Bars and Restaurants . <br/><br/>I hope to be back again sometime and look forward to eventually meeting Lina ,either in London or at home in NY . <br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Victor ;-)"

45168,891982,30-01-2012,252918,Gaëlle,"Lina was a lovely and very thoughtful host. We had a great time in her flat. Well-located, well-decorated : everything was perfect. Lina gave us some interesting addresses and events (Chinese New Year's Eve in Trafalgar Square : thanks for the tip). And she proposed us to let our luggages at her place before taking the train in the evening. A nice et helping thought, so we hadn't our bags on our backs during the day. Thanks for everything."
45168,1102932,09-04-2012,1736872,Jenny,We had a great time @ Lina's place - the location is easy for exploring London and the flat is jam packed with interesting and beautiful things. All the arrangements went smoothly - it really did feel like we were staying @ a friend's place!

45168,3246281,03-01-2013,2400201,Tao,"This,cozy,charming, confortable Nottinghill apartment has beaten our best expectations!  With our 2 kids we loved everything here.  All the ceramics, book collection and all decorative work kept our stay full of nice surprises everyday. The long rainy nights in the winter in London were made much less unbearable with projecting system watching films.<br/>Location, neighbourhood, everything else is top.  Lina is really nice and patient.<br/>If you look for a place hat feels like home, with a soul and all the convenience in London, come to this one! <br/>We would live to come back again!<br/>"
45168,3528568,12-02-2013,4833899,Theresa,"The apartment is beautiful and a great location with easy access to one of the nicest areas in London.  A walk away from Wetbourne Groves fancy boutiques or alternative Portobello Rd, with buses that take you to Camden or right to Oxford street.  The flat was clean and beautifully decorated with a wonderful kitchen I took full advantage of.  Lina was always responsive, before and duriong my stay.  I look forward to staying here again."
45168,3962594,31-03-2013,4145982,Sarah,"My daughter Savannah and I loved staying in Lina's gorgeous flat. Warm, comfortable, lovely art and a nespresso machine that we made full use off (about a hundred times a day - sorry, Lina!). Superb location - a five minute taxi ride from Paddington, and a hop, skip and a jump from the Portobello Road. Tons of atmosphere and the people in the area were friendly and cool. <br/>Lina is lovely to deal with - quick to respond and extremely kind.<br/>Highly recommended. "
45168,4418961,04-05-2013,5724138,Angela,"Lina's apartment is adorable -- my husband and I spent a few days there and felt right at home. Additionally, the location is superb. You're minutes away from several subway lines, delicious eateries, various markets and stores, and a nice stroll from Kensington Palace/Gardens and Hyde Park."
45168,4602976,14-05-2013,1011772,Kimiko,"Lina's flat is located in one of the most interesting and convenient area in central London. My husband and I enjoyed walking with our 5 months old baby to every direction from the flat. Also it was perfectly located for using public transportations like tube, bus and train. The flat is tidy, and is equipped with everything. Lina's collection of posters and books were also very interesting. Contact was always quick, although she was outside of the country.<br/>We would love to stay at her apartment, next time, too."
45168,4816846,27-05-2013,6363986,Sarah,"I spent a weekend in London, and loved staying at Lina's flat. I really appreciated that she could accommodate me with very short notice. Lina herself is lovely - very friendly and quick to respond, and is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about London. It was very much like staying at a friend's place. :) <br/><br/>The flat itself is very comfortable, clean and modern. It's in a fantastic location, with lots of shops/cafes/restaurants and public transport nearby. I also felt very safe walking around at night in the area!<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to recommend Lina's flat, and would definitely stay there again the next time I visit London!"
45168,5280277,22-06-2013,5992077,Nancy,"My husband and I stayed at Lina's apartment for 3 days this week. Lina is a great communicator and a warm host! The apartment is attractive, so very comfortable, and well-equipped for those like us who prefer to cook instead of eating out all the time!<br/><br/>The apartment is located in a great neighborhood - safe and attractive. We never heard neighbors, and the apartment was wonderfully quiet at night - even with the windows open.<br/><br/>There are a couple tube stops a 10-minute walk away, and bus lines even closer. We chose to take the 10-minute walk to the Waitrose grocery, but there are other smaller shops nearby.<br/><br/>I heartily recommend Lina and her apartment! Thanks, Lina, for a great stay!<br/><br/>"
45168,5370851,26-06-2013,4057952,Dora,"We had a good time in Lina's apartment. It is very well located in the heart of Notting Hill in a safe and nice area of London. The apartment is very well equiped with everything you may need and nicely decorated. It has lots of personal and fragile touches such as pottery, and we had to be careful with our very curious toddler, but we managed. To sum up, very in line with the title of the apartment! (Best part of town -Home from Home). <br/>"
45168,5489649,02-07-2013,4833899,Theresa,"As always Lina was an amazing host and this time I finally used the TV, great for watching movies on the big screen.  Looking fwd to my next stay.  Thanks Lina! (and sorry for being so late with my review)."
45168,5581011,07-07-2013,6144126,Catherine,"My mum and I had the pleasure of staying in Lina's flat for a few days and we had such a wonderful time! When we got to the flat, it was still being cleaned so Lina took us to the pub next to her flat (my mum and I actually ended up having dinner there and it was delicious) and bought us a drink. She told us all about London and the things we should do and see there. We got to do some of the things she suggested but still have more to do so I guess we'll have to go back! Lina's flat was perfect and had everything we could want in it and it is located in an amazing neighbourhood. Lina herself was an amazing host - so helpful, friendly and warm. I would highly recommend Lina as a host and her flat as a place to stay when you're in London! I can't wait to go back to London and stay there again!"
45168,5712713,13-07-2013,6361668,James,"A wonderful part of London minutes from everything you need, while still letting you experience a more ""real"" London away from tourist traps. Good to note you're only minutes from the central line, connecting you to all of London.<br/>Lina was incredibly responsive and always happy to help. Very clean with a great kitchen, perfect for those after a more homely place to stay.<br/>Would definetly stay again ! <br/>"
45168,6070015,29-07-2013,6414649,Amanda,"This flat was a great base for us during our four days in London.   Lina is a conscientious host who made sure everything was ready and easy for us when we arrived.  The flat is cozy and charming, with a very homey feeling, and services, including the bus and tube, are easily accessible in this neighborhood.  My wife and I stayed here with our teenage daughter, who slept on a  pullout bed in the living room, and that worked out, but the flat is probably more comfortable for for a single or couple.  "
45168,6394536,11-08-2013,6574653,Carrie,"Linas' apartment is comfortable, a definite ""home away from home"" and in an ideal location in London for the traveller seeking a place where they can not only sleep but prepare their meals and find a quiet place at the end of a busy day.  We were a family of four travelling that included a college as well as a highschool aged daughter and we were quite comfortable here.   We were so grateful for the extra space and the private bathroom that a typical small London sized hotel room may not have provided -- in addition to the benefit of being able to prepare meals in the kitchen.  We definitely felt as if we were in a home which in some ways is so much better.<br/><br/>Lina left very clear instructions, travel books and pamphlets, was available for questions via internet and in general we felt as if she was there, right with us.  The Rick Steves' London 2013 travel guide that she provided during our visit was our everyday resource. She was very supportive and helped us with all our questions.  Everything worked out with getting into the apartment via the concise instructions given.<br/><br/>The location is ideal and an easy walk to the tube at both the Notting Hill Gate, Queensway and Bayswater tube station stops.  <br/>Portobello Road is a short walk.  Kensington Park is about a fifteen minute walk or so.  My husband loved his morning runs from this apartment and Kensington Park was his favorite destination.<br/><br/>My husband and I would definitely come back to Linas' apartment and if my daughters ever travel again on their own, I would hope they could visit here again as a home away from home.  <br/><br/>"
45168,7552326,24-09-2013,7864477,Brian,"Lina is fantastic, the space is fantastic, and the neighborhood is fantastic!  Not only is it close to Portobello Road, its own neighborhood is charming and a very safe-feeling five-minute walk from a tube station. It's easy to get to from the airport by train. Lina was kind and helpful. I highly recommend! "
45168,9638942,04-01-2014,1236553,Miranda,"We had a great time in Lina's apartment. We were two adults and two children and stayed for a total of 6 nights. The flat itself is charming and the neighbourhood is great with lots of restaurants and stores incl. the amazing Portobello Rd within walking distance. Well connected to different parts of the city with frequent bus lines and tube station within proximity. Lina is very detail-oriented and provided thorough guidance and instructions for using her flat. She was also very responsive to any inquiries. We also felt at home surrounded by many familiar books and artistic preferences. The newly added projector and screen were a plus for us to watch the  New Year Eve's fireworks cuddling with our kids on the living room sofa -:)) The flat is fine for well-behaved children and well-organized adults as it has many precious decorative and artistic items that would intrigue little curious minds and could easily break. It is ideal for couples!  Overall, we had a very positive experience. "
45168,10696734,03-03-2014,8449873,Virginie,"Our stay in Lina's flat was fantastic! The apartment is great, the location is amazing and everything was well organized. We hope to come back one day! "

Cosy flat, very quiet and perfect for a couple's vacation. Notting Hill has a lot of charm and very near of london's city center.<br/>Lina was an excellent host. We will definitely come back at this place. <br/>"
45168,12292034,28-04-2014,11308152,Amy,"I had the most wonderful time staying in Lina’s beautiful flat and I can’t recommend it highly enough.  The location is absolutely perfect, close to transport, Kensington Gardens and the groovy cafes, bars, restaurants and shops of Westbourne Grove and Notting Hill.  It’s really easy to get to other parts of London too.  The flat is lovely, is excellent value and has everything you need – it’s cosy, safe, comfortable and somewhere to retreat to at the end of a long day.  I felt very at home.<br/>It’s also very quiet and I woke every morning to the sound of spring birdsong – not what you would expect in central London!<br/>Lina is so organised and helpful and it was such a lovely experience.  Will definitely be back, thank you, Lina!<br/>"
45168,14636262,23-06-2014,10853674,Karin,"We had a wonderful time in Lina's flat which is really comfy and cosy and we could recommend it deeply. In the beginning we got such precious ideas from her where to go and what to visit in her neighbourhood as well as for greater London at all. The area around her flat is excellent – quiet around the house, a few metres to the next nice pub, a few streets to cross to find a very lively and vibrant area – around Portobello Road or, what we really liked (as there is no hype about): Bayswater + Queensway. Lina is an extremely warm-hearted host and we stayed in close contact during our stay. She has organised the renting very well, so you find every information you need in a list she provides. Well done, Lina – we will definitely return to you when London will be again on the top of our travelling list :-)"
45168,15174746,04-07-2014,14455629,Heather,"We had a lovely stay in Lina's charming flat. Great neighborhood, peaceful and convenient to everything. Lina was a great host providing useful instructions and recommendations; very easy to communicate with. Would definitely stay here again!"
45168,16353083,26-07-2014,6922251,Joyce,"A cosy charming apartment that was a home away from home. We loved the location with the Portobello Market, restaurants and cafes nearby. Lina was great in her communication as a host - the TV projector was a tad complicated to set up but she was very quick in her response to resolve the issue. I would definitely recommend a stay here. "
45168,17870552,18-08-2014,11756216,Fabiana,"I went to London for a long weekend with my family,  including a 1year old boy - so I was looking for a calm area, but still close to all the nice things there are to see in London!<br/><br/>Previous comments on the host and the flat helped me decide to rent this specific apartment - indeed, Lina replied very quickly and was very attentive!<br/><br/>The flat is very well located and has everything you need!"
45168,19422123,12-09-2014,1680898,Andrew,"Everything went very well! I love the neighborhood, and you will too. Lina's place was nicely decorated and worked out perfectly."

The neighbourhood is very quiet. Further, Lina made everything for us to feel like at home. We'll definitely come back there!"
45168,21225687,13-10-2014,9124651,Are,"We spent 4 nights in this charming, inspirering and cosy flat with walls that were filled with poetry and beauty. Who could not fall in love with this place?  Very nice neighbourhood, close to Portobello Road and close to Westbourne tube station. Just perfect. Lina was a very good hostess and provided us with all the information we needed. "
45168,23851637,12-12-2014,9263625,Em,"This is the loveliest place to stay in London! Lina's apartment is not only nicely decorated, but it has this homey and cozy feeling which make you want to spend your entire day huddled up on the couch watching movies and having tea. Its location is very convenient, in a lovely quiet neighborhood with lined up Victorian townhouses,  so close to Portobello road, Notting Hill Gate, Holland Park, Kensington Gardens, and both the Central and Hemmersmith/Circle tube stations. <br/>The apartment is on the 3rd floor providing you with an amazing view- which I loved the most, because I could enjoy lovely sunrises and sunsets over Notting Hill :) <br/><br/>I stayed at Lina's apartment by myself for 3 days and then I shared the apartment with Lina which added even more pleasure to my entire stay. Lina is an interesting, smart, and utterly nice person who cares about her guests a lot. Staying with her was like staying with an old good friend. I am not exaggerating when saying that this is the best airbnb experience I have had so far!  <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place and would love to stay there again the next time I am in Belgrade."
45168,24928698,04-01-2015,19624891,Maria,Good flat in a beautiful part of london. Lina is very helpful with her guests. The flat is near the underground but there are also many buses. Unfortunately we have stayed only 3 days too few to see the wonderful city. Like me the flat is perfect for 2 people or family with a child because the sofabed is little small. However the apartment is good also for 4 adults for few days.
45168,25463037,17-01-2015,11308152,Amy,"This was my second visit to Lina's flat and, once again, I had such lovely time.  The fact that it was my second visit says it all.  Lina is a wonderful host, helpful, kind and welcoming.  Fabulous location, beautiful views, quiet, cosy, immaculate, safe, welcoming and with everything you need for a comfortable stay.  There is so much to do and see within walking distance and the public transport links are brilliant - choice of three tube lines, overground at Paddington, buses galore.  The area itself is great - lots of shops, cafes, pubs, restaurants, Kensington Gardens on the doorstep.  And if you don't want to go out then Lina's flat is a lovely retreat.  Thank you, Lina!  "
45168,29858101,13-04-2015,28381357,Winson,"Lina is super responsive host, like how she is organized and u will find that is very useful to your stay. We didnt meet Lina up but we know everything about her home, it is so warmy and clean that we hesitate to go out. For location it is close to Westborne park station and u can walk to notting hill place, so it is very good. Will definately recommend to friend and hope to stay here again for our next visit."
45168,32484077,18-05-2015,29878252,Lucia,"Nuestra visita a Londres fue sensacional y mucho ha tenido que ver hospedarse en el apartamento de Lina. Simplemente el lugar es grandioso, a pocos minutos del metro y de varias paradas de ómnibus, muy cerca de portobello, lugar maravilloso para visitar. El apartamento es estupendo, amplio y muy bien equipado pero lo mas importante fue la atencion de Lina. Nuestro vuelo se retrasó considerablemente y Lina nos recibió con sopa y pan dado que llegamos a altas horas de la noche! Fue muy amable en explicarnos detalladamente el funcionamiento del apartamento y tambien en darnos recomendaciones respecto de que visitar. Muchas gracias Lina!!!"
45168,33602717,30-05-2015,32427955,Vadim,"We stayed at Lina's flat for 1 week with our 2yo, it was a great stay and we enjoyed it very much.<br/>It's very homey and warm, has a good location with plenty of transportation around (buses and metro), restaurants, pubs, etc. is a short walking distance.<br/><br/>We didn't get a chance to meet Lina, but she was responsive to us and she is super organized so you'll know everything you need to know about your stay before you arrive."
45168,34236796,06-06-2015,21949866,Jilly,Lina gave me a very warm welcome. The flat is perfectly located only a short walk from Notting Hill which was where I spent most of my time. Lovely apartment and met my needs perfectly. 
45168,36297988,27-06-2015,31280371,David,"My hopes for this flat were high based on all the positive reviews and they were not disappointed.  Lina is a very thoughtful and helpful host who made sure all my questions and needs were taken care of. I very much enjoyed the couple of occasions we got together for drinks at her local pubs.  The flat is just as described and is a terrific home away from home in London. Though (typically for London) not large, it is conveniently and thoughtfully laid out, as well as being delightfully decorated.  Good light and cross ventilation are also a plus, and not to be taken for granted in a big city flat.  The neighborhood is just what I was looking for, quiet but lively and convenient to the center.  Supermarkets, organic groceries, and fruit/veg all nearby, as well as a wide array of restaurants, pubs and cafes. Only drawback is three flights of stairs, which may be an obstacle to people with mobility problems.  All in all I was very happy with this rental and would recommend without hesitation to family and friends."

She gave us great instructions on taking public transport, was flexible on arrival and departure times, and responded quickly to questions. Second, the apartment is wonderful. It's full of art and books and has a lot of life, it felt very 'homey.' Lastly, the neighborhood is awesome. There was always something to do, there is great food nearby, a market, good coffee....tons of stuff. We loved it. "

Mit zwei Kindern wussten wir eine Küche zu schätzen wie auch die gute Lage der Wohnung in einem angenehmen Quartier. Der Ort ist ruhig und die Einrichtung bietet alles, was man sich für einen mehrtätigen Aufenthalt  fernab der Sterilität eines Hotels wünscht. Einzig das Ausziehsofa empfiehlt sich für Erwachsene nicht, aber eine entsprechende ""Warnung"" hat uns Lina diesbezüglich im Vorfeld abgegeben. In diesem Sinne: Bestnoten und jederzeit gerne wieder!"

It's easily accessible to anywhere you may want to visit in London, but Notting Hill is also a perfect destination it its own right. Among our favorite local spots were the Ottolenghi Cafe and the Electric Cinema. Lina gave us very helpful recommendations and was immediately available for any questions. The apartment itself is cozy and has everything you need to make your visit comfortable, and because Lina shares her whole apartment, you will have an unusual amount of privacy for an AirBnB."

45168,181294490,12-08-2017,15324575,Laeth,Great location. Cute. Close to transit. Lina was so nice and helpful. Only reason we didn't give it 5 stars is there were lots of personal items and felt a bit crammed.
45168,184887122,20-08-2017,57017075,Lindsay,The home is in a central location with many great restaurants and bars close by. The pictures are a bit of a misrepresentation of the apartment as there are a lot more personal items everywhere and the bathroom could have been cleaner. Lina was a very kind host and sent a detailed manual prior to our arrival which was helpful.
45168,190915138,05-09-2017,4519863,Nancy,Very sweet and cousy flat in the centra of London. Easy to get to . Excellent area !1 Host was very friendly and helpful. <br/>Everything was very good and I had a lovely time
45168,194712819,17-09-2017,124914271,Jingyu,"Lina's place is very cozy. It's not big, but will find staying here very comfortable. The location is very good. Most tourist spots are within 30 mins public transit, and there're shops in walking distance. We enjoyed our stay!"
45168,222654835,30-12-2017,45113834,Lauren,"Me and my friends absolutely LOVED staying in Lina’s home. It was spotlessly clean and filled with lots of lovely personal touches and art. Great location and Lina left lots of suggestions for local places to eat, drink etc. I would definitely recommend staying here again. It felt like a home away from home. Lina was also very flexible with check in / check out which was so convenient! Thanks so much."
45168,224843414,04-01-2018,156008304,Tiago,"Boa localização, com comercio de bairro, supermercados, restaurantes e pubs por perto. Tem 3 estações de metro a 15min. Linha de bus (23) directa ao centro de Londres (oxford street/regents street)<br/>Apartamento muito acolhedor, limpo, com tudo o necessário para uma agradável estadia... e um aquecimento eficiente."
45168,259050180,30-04-2018,68434810,Leigha,"The flat is quiet but very close to Portobello Road, which is wonderfully eclectic. The flat itself is one of a kind! We fell in love with the neighborhood; we could have skipped all the sightseeing and happily stayed in Notting Hill. It’s a great place to stay. We’d happily return."
45168,269493274,27-05-2018,37063319,Véronique,"Great colorful place to stay in London! Location is perfect. Even if small, very comfortable and special due to all decoration objects -not main stream, original and inspiring. Lina was very kind and helpful!"
45168,286371046,06-07-2018,19426478,Andrew,"Enjoyed our stay. It's a lovely area, and we really liked the fact it was a genuine home we were staying in. There are, as some others have mentioned, quite a lot of the owners possessions in the flat, but apart from worrying that we'd break something, that was a positive."
45168,288299750,09-07-2018,41228659,Audrey,"Nous avons passés un long we familial dans l’appartement (2 adultes+2 enfants) pour une découverte de Londres. L’appartement est très bien situé, proche des transports (métros et bus), nous avons eu un vrai coup de cœur pour le quartier, non loin de Portobello Road. Assez petit mais très fonctionnel et propre. Lina a été très arrangeante avec nous, pour les horaires de départ et d’arrivée, et tout était bien expliqué (wifi, fonctionnement de l’appartement, ustensiles,adresses....) Nous recommandons vivement cet appartement et y reviendrons lors de notre prochain séjour à Londres!"
45168,289819161,13-07-2018,119494757,Zhicheng,"An enjoyable stay in Lina's flat. Good neighborhood and convenient location with so many shops, restaurants and underground stations.  There were so mamy interesting and lovely stuffs which, kind of,  made the room a little bit tight for my parents to move. But generally it was indeed a nice place to stay in London. Thank you Lina."
45168,292487962,18-07-2018,34748018,Susanna,Nice apartment in charming neighborhood. I would say that it suits for 2 people. Lina was very nice and answered quickly to our questions 
45168,294747069,22-07-2018,68712181,Gourav,No air conditioning (to my knowledge) but overall central to main attractions and host is very responsive . Would recommend to others 
45168,302048373,05-08-2018,26248121,Matt,"Great location!!!! Lina was very responsive and helpful. Check in was a breeze , especially after 24 hours of travel. Would definitely stay again."
45168,304245038,09-08-2018,203083412,Janine,Really quirky space. The girls loved the projector and enjoyed our family movie night. Great location!
45168,306083816,12-08-2018,34624233,Altug,"Perfect location and cosy apartment, perfectly described so you get what you expect .."
45168,311527382,21-08-2018,14800224,Barth,"We were in Linas colorful, interesting apartment with many plants for a few nights as a guest. In the apartment are many personal, creative and fragile individual pieces. The apartment is located in a quiet corner of London. It takes about 30 minutes by bus to the city center. Supermarket and nice restaurants are nearby. Lina is a very caring host who informs you in advance with a lot of information about everything.<br/>We felt very comfortable and like to come back to London. <br/>Thank you Lina for everything."
45168,313518548,25-08-2018,9354600,Yousra,"I spent 3 days in London with my mum and Lina’s place was exactly what we needed. It feels very “homey” because it’s lived in but there was also enough space and instructions in order for us not to disturb anything. Lina’s flat is also very tastefully decorated (really loved the art), has plenty of amenities and the bed is super comfy. The location is great, just a few minutes away from Portobello road, and easy to access by bus and underground.<br/>Would highly recommend!"
45168,342760716,29-10-2018,44518620,Jackie,I had a wonderful stay at Lina's apartment -  it was exactly like the pictures and just a short walk to the Portobello Market. Lina is very communicative and accommodating. I highly recommend!
45168,363211336,28-12-2018,27961802,Leigh,"Stay at Lina's! Cosy, cute, great location and with lots of character; Lina's home is wonderful! We had 6 nights at Lina's and we would stay here again. Not only is her home equipped with everything you could need to be comfortable, it is filled with art, literature and personality. Our 6 year old felt like drawing within the first 10 minutes of being at Lina's; it's an inspired and inspiring London abode. Beyond this, Lina was a really attentive host; she left christmas decorations, and a gift! She gave great directions and suggestions and was easily contactable. The location is wonderful as it is close to bus lines and to Royal Oak or Westbourne Grove tube stations. The no 7 bus takes you to Oxford circus and more. Portabello Road is just a right out the door, and a 5 minute stroll down the road. We took Lina's advice and ordered groceries online to be delivered when we arrived, and we ordered the Simply Taxis service which took us from Heathrow to Lina's in about 30-45 minutes, and back for 28-30£. <br/>If you have mobility issues, Lina's may not be for you, as there are stairs and you have to hop in and out of the bath for a shower. However, as a fairly unfit 41 year old, the stairs were no problem for me or for my 6 year old. We were proper Londoners for 6 days at Lina's. Ask Lina about anything- she'll help you out. Unless you like the soulless sterility of a hotel, book Lina's, and step in to her colourful and enchanted London home. This is a real AirBnB experience, one of our best ever. Thank you so much Lina!!!!"
45168,445432101,29-04-2019,181330072,Thierry,"Location, décoration, communication, everything was perfect. We just felt like home. In résumé, this is a cosy appartment in a lovely neighbourhood rented by a kind and helpful host. <br/>In addition, i must say that the sofa bed in the living room is really comfortable, which is rarely the case with this kind of equipment."
45168,487734454,14-07-2019,269535325,Cole,Lina’s flat is the epitome of cosy! Great location as well.
45168,523303159,03-09-2019,1770806,Niklas,"Lina's flat is lovely with lots of of details, it was so nice not be in a holiday apartment but in a real home. It is really cozy and also provided enough space for us three (2 adults and 1 child). The tube station Westbourne Park is close and a bus stop even closer, so you can reach everywhere you want to go. But the neigborhood is so lovely, you might just wnat to stay there. It has some nice pubs & restaurants close to the flat and supermarets are also in walking distance. Lina thought of everything and has a folder welcome folder prepared for all questions you might have, but is also quick to answer if you message her. She definitely deserves her superhost title. We spent a great week there and will gladly come back the next time we are in London."
45168,525163227,07-09-2019,151217284,Lukáš,Very nice apartment with good location. Lina was also really helpfull. Just the second bed is not for two adults
45168,540888243,04-10-2019,767597,Ann,"This is such a cute apartment. Super clean, nice location not too far from the Underground, just the right size for me. I really enjoyed staying here."
45168,587654457,03-01-2020,86343406,Shivani,"Lina was a warm and responsive host, and we enjoyed staying in her cozy home!"
46961,1.02595E+18,16-11-2023,485318726,Andrew,Lovely apartment in an ideally located development between the Kings road and Fulham road. Five minutes by bus from Sloane Square and a very short walk to Fulham Broadway. Dee communicated very well and is a great host.
46992,97850,15-09-2010,221613,Katharine,"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of staying 6 nights with Alix and Richard at their wonderful Art Deco flat. They were extremely welcoming and provided us with gorgeous breakfasts too. We also made use of the kichen so we did not have to eat out all the time. <br/><br/>The flat is close to good transport links and is situated in a very diverse, 'happening' part of London. Walking (or cycling!) distance to the lovely London Fields or Victoria Park and also the nightlife of Dalston. <br/><br/>The flat is a real haven away from the bustle of city life, with a huge, beautiful courtyard where we had breakfast in the sun. <br/><br/>Alix and Richard were lovely and friendly, while also allowing us complete independence, so we felt totally at ease and at home in their home! It was a great experience and exactly what we had hoped for, and more."
46992,99877,18-09-2010,73119,Emily & Matt,"Alix and Richard were extremely welcoming and hospitable. They even had a tray of hot tea and biscuits waiting for us when we arrived -- so thoughtful! Their home is absolutely lovely and situated in a vibrant part of Hackney. It was the perfect place to spend our last few days in London. Thanks so much you guys!<br/><br/>"
46992,112638,05-10-2010,123136,Kirsten,"Alix and Richard are wonderful hosts. My husband and I really enjoyed staying with them in Hackney. Their home is in a great location, very close to two overland stations and a variety of buses which go into central London. The building itself is quite unique and and the hard work they have done on their flat is paying off - it's a relaxing and warm environment. We also really enjoyed having our breakfast in the private courtyard! Looking forward to staying with Alix and Richard again sometime. "
46992,115113,09-10-2010,133862,My,"What fabulous hosts Alix and Richard were for my very short one night stay in their quirky art deco building! I had their very comfy sofabed and a great breakfast cooked by Richard, but their hospitality extended to the very kind gesture of a ride down to the wedding brunch I was attending the next morning on their cool yuba cargo bike and allowing me to see East London in style, as well as a crash course in learning how to ride a bicycle! With a hangover, 5 hours sleep and non-grip flip flops, they were very paitient with me! Alix/Richard - I'll be coming back for a ride in your Indonesian antique rickshaw, this time without my suitcase! Thanks a million again, your hospitality was superb and very much appreciated ;)"
46992,116606,11-10-2010,251927,Jan,"Having Alix and Richard as hosts transformed our trip to London from average weekend stay to wonderful and joyful experience of all London flavors. Being in London for the very first time and thus constantly getting lost in the streets of Hackney, Alix patiently stayed on the phone and navigated us to their apartment. And what an apartment it was! Beatiful art deco style, über-comfortable bed, incredible atmosphere of their garden and fountain. Biscuits and lovely English tea prepared by Alix made our souls joyful after long travel from Bratislava, and Richard not only cooked excellent dinner for us, he also made detailed map for our Tour de City while we were sleeping!<br/><br/>Contacting Alix and Richard was definitely the best holiday choice we ever made, with no exaggeration. We could have never hoped for such great experience of London without them. Thanks to Alix and Richard, we got to know the best parts of London - not only the tourist attractions, but the real London at Broadway Market, Londonfields (by bike!) or Brick Lane. And did we tell you they offered us to read their books, too? My girlfriend got immersed in Independent Store Guide and I finished Richard´s book on urban planning while staying in their apartment.<br/><br/>Thank you, Alix and Richard! Your hospitality was fantastic, and you definitely made two new friends and fans in Slovakia! We adore your apartment, your way of life and your lovely work, too."
46992,121837,18-10-2010,254570,Germaine,"Alix and Richard were a joy to live with. They catered to my every need, even checking before my arrival to see what I'd like to have for breakfast and dinner. When I arrived, they'd stocked up on plenty of fruit and milk (since I mentioned that my breakfasts consisted mainly of fruits)!! Their apartment was very clean and everything functioned properly. Their location was perfect. Great bus and train service to the area. A lively but not loud neighborhood. Quite frankly, they provided everything I needed for relaxing weekend break. Will be coming back for sure."
46992,131353,01-11-2010,26343,Katja,What a great start!!! We looooved the rickshaw ride. Alix and Robert are lovely hosts. We had a wonderful time and we´ll be back for sure!! Thanks again for everything. Your place is soooo great!!!
46992,147337,30-11-2010,287562,Emmanuela,"Alix and Richards have been full of attention and discreet.<br/>One of us have used the entire living room as personal room for almost a week without any problem...<br/>At our arrive we found a fridge full of food for our breakfasts and we have felt easier.<br/>The apartment is cute with a lovely courtyard full of flower, that you can see from your bed!<br/>The bus are very close and well-connected with important places of the city, the train is 5-10 minute walking.<br/>We are definitely satisfacted from our stay."
46992,161201,31-12-2010,90737,Laura,"The directions to the flat were fantastic and spot-on. Alix provided great advice on transportation options from the airport. She graciously accommodated us despite our early arrival time. She was very friendly and helpful, even reproducing a detailed street map for us to take away, as WiFi was unavailable. The location is great for access to Brick Lane, Spitalfields, Shoreditch and Columbia Road. The bus stop is just steps away from the front door. The flat was clean and cozy. We had a pleasant continental breakfast the following morning and were on our way. I think this would be a great place for a single traveler with the combination of price, location, and comfort!"
46992,209502,26-03-2011,101177,Karen,"a very lovely room staying with a nice couple. i have no complaints about the room, which overlooks a fountain courtyard. alix was very kind to send me instructions getting to and from both airports. as for the location, it depends what you want. i had to rely on buses to get where i wanted to be and that was a bit of a drag bc although they run frequently they get caught in lots of traffic. i live in nyc and am used to walking everywhere, not used to having to rely on buses so that was a surprise. but probably my own fault bc i did not research location.  if you want to stay out all day and dont care about being far from places then this is a nice option. you will be in a couple's apt sharing their bathroom and kitchen, much like a close, roommate situation. however, they are friendly and the place is VERY clean. "
46992,211103,28-03-2011,430693,Marie,"Great, great, great!!! It was really fun to stay in Hackney, definitely the place to go if you are not into touristy London. They were so helpful to navigate all the Tube closures, and have an excellent stash of tourist books. Check out the local coffee shop too, super tasty. <br/> I'll definitely be back, and next time I'll make more time to spend in the neighborhood. And make sure you take the opportunity to borrow a bicycle!!!<br/> "
46992,213230,30-03-2011,430505,Tania,My partner and I had a lovely stay in Hackney. It was a dream. It felt just like home. They are very gracious hosts.
46992,231881,19-04-2011,455218,Jimena,"We stayed at Alix and Richard's home for 5 days, and I can tell it was a fantastic experience! I can really recommend them as hosts!<br/>We had a great time with Alix and Richard, the house is beautiful, placed in a very cozy neighborhood!<br/>Even though Alix was not feeling very well she did the best to make our stay confortable and was willing to help us in everything we need. <br/><br/>"
46992,258636,10-05-2011,254570,Germaine,"My second stay with Alix and Richard was nothing short of lovely. They were just as welcoming as during my first visit almost a year ago. Fridge was stocked with plenty of fresh fruits for me. And I was even treated to a very lovely - and very healthy - dinner, complete with wine. And of course I love, love the apartment decor. Thanks again for being such great hosts"
46992,268186,17-05-2011,539748,Katrin,"We had a very nice stay in Hackney. The room was lovely, the bed comfy, and Alix and Richard were great hosts. They cooked us a wonderful breakfast on the weekend - loved the poached eggs! We're just a little sad that we can't find crumpets in Switzerland. They also gave us great tips to navigate our way around London. Hackney is a nice neighbourhood, a bit away from touristy London, but not too far. We would love to come back sometime! "
46992,279330,24-05-2011,554124,Michelle,"Alix and Richard were both very accommodating to us while we were there. They really put care into the breakfasts they prepare (in the weekends), which were really good, of course. It was nice that they were also the best people to ask when it comes to which way best to get to wherever you want to get in London/around -- very handy! All in all a very comfortable stay -- in their very beautiful and clean apartment. <br/>The only thing to note is that Hackney is a little bit farther away from the main city attractions like The Big Ben etc, so if you meant to stay farther - this is for you. Else, be prepared to spend some time on the bus (a nice journey with a lot of city sights), before you reach town. <br/>"
46992,289882,31-05-2011,458001,Ruth,"Alix and Richard's place is a lovely hideaway in busy Hackney. Beautifully decorated and full of interesting bits and bobs. Alix and Richard were very generous hosts. You might think that Hackney is a long way from the centre -- but compared to the broom-cupboard sized hotel room with very ordinary breakfasts that we had elsewhere in London, it's well worth half an hour on the bus!! And we really enjoyed being able to borrow the bikes."
46992,298720,05-06-2011,555697,Janna,"Alix and Richard have a lovely home and were great hosts during our stay.  They were helpful with directions, provided information about London and their neighborhood and had an extremely nice home.  Alix made us a delicious breakfast our last day and provided us with tons of yummy food the other morning we were at her home.  They were a delight to stay with!"
46992,313048,13-06-2011,580338,Eleanor,"We had a delightful stay with Alix & Richard, they were great hosts and chatted to us about which markets we could walk to, as well as providing a very cute illustrated map of places to eat and drink and things to do in the area. The weekend breakfasts we were treated to were delicious, and included (not to put the pressure on for future guests A & R!) perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. After a day wandering around markets - Broadway Market on Saturday was a highlight, and Columbia Rd Flower Market on Sunday, (both within walking distance if you like walking) we were grateful for the super comfy bed. "
46992,320801,18-06-2011,214795,Dennis,"As a business traveler I need somewhere comfortable and accessible. Alix and Richard's place fulfilled that need in spades but with the added bonus of offering what for me is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in outside of a luxury hotel. <br/><br/>Other bonuses include a welcome cup of tea each morning, a pleasant view out onto a courtyard garden and great access to pretty much anywhere in the City of London via the frequent bus and tube services. <br/><br/>If you're into Art Deco design then you'll love this place.<br/><br/>Alix and Richard are very much into sustainability which is always welcome and will gladly regale you with tales of success they've had in working at the local level to make where they live an example to others. That's a refreshing change some of my buddies will welcome.<br/><br/>While I didn't have time to take in the local area, they provide a very helpful guide and local map which helped me figure out the best bus stops to use and how to get there!! <br/><br/>Top class in every respect."
46992,338191,27-06-2011,685582,Jane,My daughter and I had a lovely stay with Alex and Richard who were kind and helpful hosts.
46992,374829,15-07-2011,767926,Rex,Alix and Richard were wonderful hosts!  They were amazingly helpful and kind.  And their place in Hackney is beautiful and oh so very easy to get into the center of London.  The neighborhood is quiet and easy to get around.  And the secure enclosed parking was a HUGE bonus!
46992,390985,23-07-2011,677296,Gary,"Nice room, very clean flat and lovely and quiet. All good."
46992,427756,08-08-2011,623823,Ian,"We were more than happy with our stay with Alix and Richard, it was our first Airbnb experience and they were lovely helpful people that made you feel very comfortable in their home. The bed was very comfortable and the flat was very near to transport both bus and train.  We would definitely recommend it to others. Thanks for the wine and chats and helping us with our computer. Hope to see you again one day. Thanks Viv and Ian Jones Victoria .Australia<br/>"
46992,449427,16-08-2011,26343,Katja,"Alix and Richard are great hosts, they live in a very lively and safe area. Their apartment is very light and spacious. Their peppermint tea is great!!! And everyone should try one of the bikes. Alix and Rick are very passionate cyclers and have very good tipps for cycling the city! Thanks for the comfy bed, that we had for the second time. I wouldn´t hesitate to stay with them again and totally recommend staying with them to anyone who´s going to London."
46992,474338,25-08-2011,852395,Heiner,"My grandson and I stay for little less than a week with Alix and Richard in their wonderful apartment. Both are so wonderful and helpful hosts. Alix provided great advice on transportation options from the airport. The directions to the flat were fantastic and spot-on. Alix gave us with a colorised street-map designed by herself which was a great help to find the interesting places in Hackney, pubs, coffee shop, parks, train station, restaurants and more.<br/>Their place in Hackney is beautiful and it’s so very, very easy to get into the center of London. Take Overground, Subway or bus, it’s all very easy.<br/>The Saturday breakfasts we were invited to were delicious, and included  perfectly cooked scrambled eggs (said my grandson!).<br/>Thanks for the comfy bed, that we shared. I wouldn´t hesitate to stay with Alix and Richard again and totally recommend staying with them to anyone who´s going to London. <br/>Thanks, Heiner and Nepomuk, Lower Bavaria, Germany<br/>"

46992,545065,19-09-2011,888078,Harm,"The reception was kind, the room very nice with exceptional good beds.<br/>On Sunday we got a very good warm breakfast which did us good for our trip home.<br/>We will certainly return and recommend Alix' B&B."
46992,562703,24-09-2011,1030783,Ignasi,"Our first Airbnb experience, and it was a great one. Hotels in London are often of dubious quality and mostly, expensive. Alix is a very welcoming host that truly provides a ""just like home"" experience. Cozy house, nice breakfast and wonderfully comfortable bed (really, no exaggeration here). Location may seem far from City Center but it is no hassle to commute, and it's free from its rushing madness. Better than any hotel, definitely."
46992,590149,02-10-2011,1143286,Sebastian,"Aix is super nice, helpful and friendly. I stayed at her place for the first couple of days when I moved to London. She gave me recommendations on the area, and drew maps and helped me a lot to feel at home in this city. The room was great as well - very neat, clean and comfortable!<br/>Great host & great apartment, would definitely stay there again."
46992,619361,11-10-2011,1142591,Chiara,"My boyfriend and I stayed for four days at Alix's place. I truly recommend Alix as a host, by staying at her place you have the opportunity to stay in a wonderful Art Deco Building which really adds to the whole experience. <br/><br/>Our room was nice and clean, the bed really comfortable and warm. Also there was a good thick curtain meaning you wouldn't wake up at the crack of dawn (sometime you don't have good shades in British houses). Alix provided us with nice food items for breakfast: tea, coffee, milk, croissant, bagel, different jams, eggs, sausages and cooked us a lovely breakfast on saturday. We could use the fridge to store food too. The bathroom is spotless, with a good shower. <br/><br/>Also, don't be put off by the lack of a Tube station nearby, there are loads of bus connections to basically everywhere and Hackney Central overground is just a 5 minutes walk away. And by staying here you'll have the chance to discover a less touristy London including London Fields and Broadway Market, Stoke Newington, walking along the canal etc which makes for a nice change from the insanity of Central London. <br/><br/>Almost forgot: you can also borrow bikes, which is really cool. <br/><br/>A great place, lovely host, good value for money, would definitely go back.

46992,840861,06-01-2012,1262746,Alberto,"Full marks to Alix and her beautiful place. We spent five days in London last Christmas and staying at Alix’s was a great decision. Firstly, her flat is very well-connected to the city centre by bus, which is a cheaper way to travel than the tube plus you get to see London unfold before you. Moreover, her beautifully decorated flat overlooks a courtyard so it is very quiet and relaxing. On top of that, the guest room boasts an extremely comfortable bed. <br/><br/>If you are lucky enough to stay during the weekend, don’t miss Alix’s breakfast; she really goes the extra mile preparing it. As for Alix, she is very friendly and helpful; her title of “superhost” is well deserved. If you ask her in advance, she can lend you a couple of bicycles. <br/><br/>Finally, Hackney has got a good vibe about it. We got very fond of the Pembury Tavern; it is good place near Alix’s to go for a quiet pint. In a nutshell, we highly recommend Alix´s to anybody who wants to visit London.<br/>"

46992,1123818,13-04-2012,1100852,Ashish,"We, a family of three from India were with Alix for almost 4 days. The stay at 20, Strand Building will remain in our memory forever. This was really a homely experience, something different in a business like city - London. What to say about Alix... From the time we arrived at her, she took very good care of us. Alix helped us with the travel in London. And what to say about the best English breakfast she prepared for us on our last day ! It was yummy .... mushrooms, potatoes, beans, breads, tomatoes....<br/><br/>The flat was cosy, the room was nicely organised. Very very comfortable bed. Refrigerator always full with food ! And superb garden view.<br/><br/>Alix guided us on our travel. She has the best info available on London and specifically Hackney ! The guidelines and maps were so perfect. She came with us late at night to show us the bus stop without any displeasure. Also on our final day - showed the best and cheapest route to Heathrow.....<br/><br/>Would definitely recommend this one to all !"

Any questions we had she was able to answer or would look into it and get back to us within the day. There was some trouble with our front door key when we first checked in, and Alix went the extra mile to make sure we got a copy that worked as soon as possible. The flat looks exactly like the photos and the bed was extremely comfortable."

It really is a unique building and, with the large, internal courtyard, an oasis of calm. It’s very quiet, and then you step out of the building into the bustle and excitement of north London.

46992,20285754,27-09-2014,19179221,Ida,"Alix was very welcoming from the start, weeks before we made the trip to London. All the information on the website is also very accurate. The neighborhood was just as nice as she described it, close to the central parts of London, but quite and nice for resting and sleeping nighttime. The Strand Building is really beautiful and nobody has insight to the place when you're there.<br/>It was not possible to get access to the room before 5pm the first day, so we had a meal at a really nice cafe nearby (thank you for the tip Alix!), where they had really nice cakes together with great coffee as well. <br/>There were no problems sorting things out with Alix. The last day she wanted us to be out of the apartment at 10am, but we needed to keep our bags there until 2pm, and that was OK with her. :) "

The room was nice and comfortable in an art deco building close to Hackney, which has every thing you need.<br/>Alix likes her personnel space so visitors to this Airbnb need to know that she expects you to either stay in your room or go out.

Alix even helped us move our very heavy luggage to our next Airbnb on one of her trolly bikes! 
46992,49278207,02-10-2015,44832292,Scott,Alix is a great host and my stay felt like being at home. The area has some great walks along the canal very close to Alix's home. I can thoroughly recommend staying here
46992,50126552,09-10-2015,43033141,Robert,"Alix was a perfect host. Very helpful and caring. Her flat is beautiful and room itself is very clean, bright and comfortable. It was my first Airbnb experience and I'm absolutely satisfied with it. I definitely recommend it! "
46992,51205715,18-10-2015,44459608,Katherine,"I had a great time staying at Alix's charming home. She is a wonderful host and makes you feel right at home. She was very accommodating as my living situation was being sorted out and even saved the dates after my booking so I could extend my stay. The room is perfect, very large with lots of space to hang your things and feel comfortable. The area was lovely, close to Hackney central and loads of buses to get your to different areas. I would definitely recommend staying here and would absolutely stay here again. Thanks Alix for your lovely hospitality! "
46992,52271736,27-10-2015,44459608,Katherine,This was my second stay with Alix. She was very kind to let me stay longer while I waited to move into my new flat. My second stay was just as wonderful as my first. I was very comfortable in the room and it really felt like I was in my own home and not just staying in a b&b. I will miss our chats and I really appreciate all the help you gave me while I stayed with you. You are a great host and such a wonderful person. All the best and please stay in touch :) 
46992,53281033,07-11-2015,45447682,Anton,"Alix was waiting for me outside when I arrived. She's very responsive in email and I was at home the moment I arrived in her place.<br/><br/>Her Hackney apartment was very spacious. The bed was so comfortable and the room had a lot of cabinets, a working table, lots of hangers, and all the tiny detail that matters.<br/><br/>I love the view of the garden from the room.<br/><br/>I have my own personal ref with apples, chocolate croissant, milk and orange juice.<br/><br/>She is very detailed during the orientation with waste segregation and how she wants the bathroom organized.<br/><br/>She is very accommodating and I got a glimpse of London life. She stays in the room next door, and I take every chance to talk to her to know about London.<br/><br/>She would make me coffee or tea every time its possible. She would communicate in advance and set the right expectation.<br/><br/>The description in the listing is very accurate. Although I need to add that the toilet handle needs to be fixed. <br/><br/>It's true that the Hackney Central is quite near and the bus stations are very convenient. The short cut though to go to the apartment passes through an old church and cemetary. It was a bit creepy to pass every night but I got used to it.<br/><br/>The place is near the Dalston area which is the hipster cool area in London. I love the neighborhood and the area.<br/><br/>Wifi is so fast and really helpful for digital nomads. <br/><br/>It's a bit difficult to go if coming from the airport. You have to take a taxi specially if you have a big luggage like I did. <br/><br/>The nearest station is Hackney Central.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a place in East London!<br/><br/>Thank Alix for the wonderful stay :)<br/><br/>"
46992,53638802,10-11-2015,7071867,Sasa,very nice place in a cool art deco building with easy access to buses and overground. it was a pleasant stay and the host was nice and forthcoming

Station) and loads of buses to get you to different areas. <br/>I would definitely recommend staying here and would absolutely stay here again to have breakfast together sharing  sweetness! hahahah :)<br/>Thanks Alix for your hospitality and for your kind heart!"

The room was cosy, well-equipped and spacious, with a comfy bed and lots of thick blankets in case it got cold... which it didn't! There was a place for everything, and everything in its place, and Alix made me feel really welcome - she'd thought ahead of all the little details that help make a house a home. Totally recommend! Clapton is a lovely area, too :)"
46992,72013905,30-04-2016,873968,Manja,"I've had a wonderful time at Alix's place. Actually I'm still having it because I'm staying a little longer since I'm feeling very comfortable here. The apartment, which is part of a beautiful Art Deco building, is lovingly decorated, clean, spacious, bright and quite quiet. The same goes for the room - there's a very comfy bed and loads of space for clothes ect. There's an ensuite bathroom with a spacious shower which is very modern and clean. What I love most is the yard - so beautiful and calming! Hackney Central station is a 7min walk away and there are many bus stations nearby. Alix is very kind, caring and helpful. I'm glad I found this place! "

46992,89455066,28-07-2016,5125423,Elizabeth,"<br/>Alix was the most incredible hostess I've had to date. She welcomed me into her flat with clear, simple instructions for house rules (like shoes off at the door--because of new flooring throughout the whole home!!--locking up when I get home, how to use the washing machine and tumble drier, etc), and also then added that she was available if I needed her, but that I didn't have to feel obligated to her company. <br/>Fortunately, Alix and I got along quite well. So, in addition to the flat being recently remodeled (just imagine the style in the pictures, but newer and cuter!), she helped  me find bus and train routes (transport knowledge is her *thing*!) throughout London, and we also had a few really lovely conversations. <br/>If you are looking for a roommate (flat mate, as they say in the UK) who shares your preference for logic, relaxed company, and privacy, this place is it. <br/>Plus... Hackney is amazing. I came home from visiting friends quite late a few nights, and never once felt unsafe. The whole town is lit up like a Christmas tree until very late (perhaps all night?) for safety reasons--even the churchyard behind Alix's place. People trod through the area at all times of day and night, and it's very safe. <br/>Did I mention how much you'll love it here?<br/> "
46992,91418546,05-08-2016,79857905,Samuel,"beautiful apartment, where you instantly feel at home, vibrant area in a close location to anything you can imagine (fancy a street market or Olympic Park?), and the most lovely host ever - thank you Alix, we could not wish for a better place to stay for our trip to London!"

46992,158048198,05-06-2017,45768792,Cameron,Alix is a wonderful host. My boyfriend and I stayed with her while spending a few days in London. Her place is extremely comfortable and she is extremely accommodating as a host. Hackney is a chill place to escape to when the tourist crowds (and prices) start to weigh you down. There are some really awesome restaurants in walking distance. Highly recommend Alix!
46992,160531949,14-06-2017,74393650,Jacyln,Alix is a thoughtful and friendly host. I had a comfortable stay. She provided handy booklets and pamphlets on London and even write up a folder about the neighbourhood which was very informative.

It's a 10 min walk from the train.  The area has cafes and food, but everything closes early.  The area is poorer than some areas, but I never felt unsafe at all."

The room was exquisite, beautifully furnished all in keeping with the apartment’s overall stylish design. Alix was incredibly kind and helpful during my stay and is the perfect host. Her organisation and preparation is flawless from guidebooks to a stash of hot chocolate in the room’s very own cupboard of goodies.  This is not just 5-star accommodation it's edging into 7-star territory."

46992,180436301,10-08-2017,143031864,Shuhebur,"Wife and I stayed at Alix's place for 4 nights in August. We were visiting family nearby and needed a place to stay and to get ready for a few weddings. First off Alix was very accommodating around issues collecting the key and we managed to come to a suitable arrangement which we were very grateful for. The room and flat in general was very beautiful, comfortable and clean. We had everything provided for us that we could need, from teas and coffees, access to iron and board, etc. Alix and Noel were both very friendly and helpful,  it was an absolute pleasure to meet them both. We didn't spend too long in the room as we had to be out and about but it made for a very comfortable homely stay, a great place to rest each night and would definitely recommend and definitely go back if given the chance. Thank you Alix and Noel!"
46992,184346314,19-08-2017,5396844,Evie,"Such a lovely sanctuary in the heart of East London. I would highly recommend Alix's place whether it's for a short city break or something a little longer to explore London and around. Incredible hospitality, swift communication and a very beautiful room.  Bonus points for the serene garden area right outside the door. Gold star accommodation."

It's also very well connected with the overground and numerous buses seconds from the front door to help you get anywhere in town - but why would you want to when you have the best of Hackney only minutes walk from the apartment!<br/>She really has paid attention to detail to make sure you have the best possible stay, which is exactly what happened.  It's a shame my work sent me out of town for a week during my stay, because the bed is so incredibly comfy!<br/>Very highly recommend Alix and her place to everyone!"

The bed is possibly one of the best I have ever slept on, very comfortable but supporting.  Nicely decorated, looking out to the unusual hacienda courtyard, peaceful at night but great location for the day.  Alix and her partner Noel are very easy going and make sure you feel at home, with everything you need, and accomodating to the things travellers bring (in my case three big pieces of luggage!).  Thanks Alix for a great stay!"

The friendly atmosphere is also a bonus in addition to the sparkling cleanliness. This is always top on my list when I stay in London and I can't recommend Alix's room highly enough. It's also very close to reliable and fast transport links to take you all around the city and perfectly located if you are flying in or out of London City Airport.
46992,229959468,26-01-2018,131084130,Anna,Alix was a great host and made me feel very welcome and at home. The room was lovely as was the ensuite.

46992,230558591,28-01-2018,29782629,Anne,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Alix'.  The building itself is very interesting and the courtyard outside the flat very impressive.  There are many cafès and restaurants close by and a great Scandinavian bakery. There are also public transport close by.  The bedroom and ensuite was very comfortable and we were able to use the dining area as well as having access to the kitchen fir making drinks.   Alix was a very discreet host and very welcoming.  We would certainly recommend this.
46992,240256151,04-03-2018,5862416,Laurence,"Alix's place is the best of Airbnb experience. The room and en-suite bath are like a cosy luxury mini apartment in a really beautiful home (so many gorgeous details, I don't know when she finds the time in her busy life), and a fabulous area with tons to discover. Alix is a top host, really friendly and helpful and she has a wealth of knowledge about life in London. Don't miss a walk through the park around the nearby church where you will see beautiful heritage Victorian homes, treat yourself to a shopping spree in the nearby Burberry factory outlets, watch a film in the Hackney picture house and sample the local food markets and parks (London Fields is a must). These are all a short walk away, but the area is also super well connected to the centre. You will always be happy to return to Alix's beautiful, quiet and comfortable place (great bed), no matter the weather!"
46992,245422981,22-03-2018,67335604,Chris And Erika,"Alix's apartment is very stylish, fresh and light in an amazing listed Art Deco building, just a few minutes walk from the heart of Hackney. A perfect base for either exploring all the fantastic bars, restaurants and shops in the neighbourhood, or for hopping onto a train or bus to take you into the middle of town. However, what you don't expect is the peace and tranquillity that surrounds you once you climb the steps to a beautiful courtyard and enter her apartment. We slept in silence every night and awoke to birdsong. Perfect for recharging the batteries after a busy day. Alix was a lovely host who obviously wanted us to feel comfortable and at home."

Lots of great dining options in the area. Alix is easy to communicate with and quick to reply from the time I requested booking until our departure. She was very considerate and thoughtful for our request for checking-in as well as making sure our room was comfortably warm before we got home on those chilly nights. Highly recommend this place. While some may find the surrounding area a bit sketchy, we felt safe even late at night."

She was happy to help with transport advice and answer any other questions I had, and was always up for a chat and a cup of tea when we both got the chance, but was also very respectful of my space. Everything was thoughtfully set up, clean, and straightforward. Transport was easy and convenient from her place, with several buses and the overground available. I would love to stay here again and will definitely recommend Alix's to any friends.<br/>Thanks Alix! xx"

The recently renovated interior is decorated with mid-century vintage furniture. I loved the wide plank solid oak floor. The house is super clean.<br/>Bright and good sized guest's bedroom is facing to the court yard with full-height window.  In-suite bathroom is a huge plus.<br/>Alix is a kind and responsive host.
46992,538781665,30-09-2019,14058204,Linda,"Alix is truly a superhost. She was a gracious and welcoming host. Her apartment was lovely, with very creative touches.

Alix has carried through the Art Deco theme of the building into the tasteful decorative touches in the apartment. Alix herself was warm, welcoming and helpful. One of the best places I have stayed in!!"

Highly recommended!"
46992,563296803,12-11-2019,39628338,Lorena,"My parents stayed at Alix's place. They loved everything about it. The place was impeccable and beautifully furnished. Alix is very sweet and responsive. She made my parents feel at home without invading their privacy. The location of the place is also great, right next to a bus stop and the overground. Absolutely recommend!"
46992,565228726,17-11-2019,263772001,Faith,"Nice bedroom, it feels clean and looks stylish. Alix also provides a wide selection of teas, which is great. The overground is not too far from the apartment, approximately 8-10min walk. However, there isn’t much to do in the area (Hackney)."
46992,572645126,03-12-2019,8300531,Natalie,"Alix’s space is a lovely and eclectic home, you really feel that Alix has taken a lot of care with attention to detail. Alix was an excellent hostess, very considerate and accommodating. The room is cosy and colourful, plenty of space to unpack and relax. I really didn’t need to ask for one thing while I was a guest. Transport links are great, a number of buses stop outside the building which go into central London and there’s also Hackney Central and Hackney Downs overground stations are within short walking distance. I would definitely stay with Alix again."
46992,573513911,06-12-2019,8065260,Tom,"Alix has made what I would imagine always to have been a lovely space into something truly special. The building, built around a courtyard, has been converted into an impressive accomodation. You have your own entrance into the (shared) sitting room and kitchen  (which can be separated by double doors). The whole place has been lovingly updated and Alix clearly has an eye for internal decoration, furniture, and art. The overall effect is comfortable, cosy and unique.<br/>Your accomodation - with its own door - is off the sitting room, comprising a new - and sparkling clean - shower room (with toilet), and comfortable and tastefully decorated bedroom.<br/>Alix is informed about her neighbourhood, prompt to reply, and relaxed.<br/>I loved staying here and would do so again in a heartbeat."
46992,578355024,17-12-2019,179649915,Monica,"Alix was a wonderful host. This was my first time staying in an Airbnb with a private room rather than having the entire place to myself and I must say that she exceeded my expectations. I was a bit nervous that staying with a stranger would be awkward, but that was not the case at all. Her home is wonderful and she is so very welcoming. I loved the decor as well-very modern and homey. I would absolutely recommend her home to other travelers. Thank you, Alix!"
46992,580287268,22-12-2019,84182,Stevie,"I had a great stay at Alix's place – enjoying the super comfortable bed and the soothing sounds of the water feature just outside the bedroom window in the building's courtyard area. Alix was very welcoming and great with her communication in advance. Everything was sparkling clean, including the en-suite bathroom. The room was very cosy, with books, interesting trinkets and extra blankets and a radiator, which I didn't need to use. Highly recommended!"
46992,582609535,27-12-2019,94362531,Julia,"Alix!  Is a very nice and willing person, it was nice to have been in her house!  It is very nice cozy and clean! I highly recommend it. Thanx a lot"

Her apartment made me feel like home and the room I stayed in was really nice and cosy. <br/>Furthermore, Alix was a really easy host to live with and she showed much respect when it came to me having my own time,  as well as gave the opportunity for great conversations.<br/>Alix gave me advice on how to easily live in London and what to think about when it comes to buying food, getting around and future living in the city. She also let me borrow her bike and further even showed me the quickest way for me to get to school. Really helpful! <br/>Thank you, Alix, for you're professional and warm welcome to London!"
46992,602544167,07-02-2020,8065260,Tom,"My second stay at Alix's lovely, stylish flat - as before, everything sparkling clean & communication excellent. I love waking to the sound of water from the water feature in the courtyard outside the room.<br/>The area is full of interesting places to eat and drink - the Pembury Tavern is great for a pint, & try PALAETTE on Mare Street for breakfast."
46992,608641391,21-02-2020,8065260,Tom,"Another lovely stay at Alix's  stylish flat in Clapton. Well connected via several frequent bus services and not one, but two overground stations, and with plenty of choice nearby to eat and drink. And Alix herself is a consummate host - can't recommend it highly enough."
46992,611184290,26-02-2020,16326830,Saskia Fraser,"Alix's place is gorgeous - light, stylish and comfortable. We had been a bit worried about the privacy because of it being a room in someone else's home, but the bedroom and bathroom felt very private. It was a great base to explore London from.

46992,616665965,10-03-2020,46410057,Lois,"Alix’s place to date is one of nicest and best Air bnb’s I’ve ever stayed in since I started using the app years ago. <br/>It was the perfect location for my partner and I. Approximately only being a 5-6 minute walk from Hackney Central station. Meaning the area was perfect as we were never short of options for food or drinks with there being a load of supermarkets, bars and restaurants nearby. With plenty of other shops in Hackney and Clapton to browse leisurely. <br/>Alix was a great host too, ensuring we knew all the security measures from the get go and provided breakfast items. As well as guides for the area. And made us feel comfortable.<br/>We had our own private room, which was perfect (cosy) for two people. Was super clean and kitted out with lots of towels, wardrobe space and amenities in the form of a kettle and cups/ mugs. <br/>I would definitely stay here again for the comfort, the art-deco design aspect alone and the gorgeous courtyard."

47192,104971,25-09-2010,35017,David,Daniel is very kind and super helpful. His place is very clean and nice and in a wonderful location (very close to the Camden Town Underground station). I highly recommend staying with Daniel and I will certainly look to stay with him the next time I am in London.
47192,113534,07-10-2010,222093,Maya,"I had a lovely time at Rocco Boni, it was very boni indeed. Daniel is the best host you can imagine. I was picked up at Camden Town by him within 5 mins of my arrival. The bedroom which he rents out is large enough for two people to move around in. Everything was super clean. It was great to wake up to the smell of fresh coffee every morning. Daniel was respectful of my space in his apartment. I could cook and use his dishes which saved me money. He gave me a map of London and even lent me his private umbrella when I realized I forgot mine. He gave me tips to get around London when there was a tube strike. He looked on the internet for me to find the best connection to Gatwick airport. In one line: This is a great guy at a great place to stay in London. I am looking forward to stay at Rocco Boni again!!!"

47192,125613,24-10-2010,222093,Maya,"I am writing this review for my mom who stayed at Rocco Boni for 4 days. ""Daniel has a friendly guest-room with a great view on the London skyline, with a generous, great quality bed. The room is very clean. Daniel cooks his guests fresh tea or coffee in the morning. He is a fabulous host, very helpful. He went out of his way to make my stay very pleasant. Thanks again, Daniel!"" Wil from Holland"
47192,131593,01-11-2010,268316,Katie,"Daniel was a great host!  He was very helpful before I arrived and had loads of information on London and the Camden Town area.  The flat was nice, very clean and near a tube stop as well.  This was my first time using airbnb and if this is a general example of how the site and flats work, I will definitely use it again!!  Thank you, Daniel!"
47192,144098,24-11-2010,24382,Joe,"Daniel provides an artfully designed, spotless flat in a fun and convenient neighborhood.  He's a very accommodating host; both a knowledgeable Londoner and great conversation partner.<br/> ** <br/>The room: Larger than expected, with a large bed, work desk, table, and occasional chairs. The provided linens were great.<br/> ** <br/>The flat: Thoughtful design and immaculately clean. Take the lift to the top floor of the tallest building in the area.  Through its many windows you'll have unobstructed views, fresh air, plenty of light. I managed to snap one of the clearer London sunrises I've seen.<br/> ** <br/>The neighborhood:  You'll be on the block with 24-hour buses to most major areas, and it's a 3 to 5-minute walk to the Camden Town tube on the Northern line.  I never waited more than 10 minutes for any sort of transport (but I might have blacked out that one night, so while it might have been longer, I'm none the wiser), so it's equality suited to leisure or morning commute.  The immediate surrounding area has a supermarket (Sainsbury's); grocery and convenience stores; bars, cocktails lounges, and nightclubs; pubs, restaurants, and fast food, and cafes; at least one hardware, home, and paint store; the Odeon movie theatre; jazz and other music venues; mobile/cellular retailers; wine and booze shops; and apparel/shoes, including H&M and Gap.  If you need anything else, get it from Camden Market, especially if you need it in leather.<br/>"
47192,146633,29-11-2010,287438,Sze,"Daniel is a perfect host! He's super nice, so as his apartment. On the day we checked in, another guest just left. Daniel managed to tidy up the room in a very short period of time and let us in. The room is very tidy, modern, and facing a great view-we've lived in London for 1 year before but we have never seen such a beautiful London! Will definitely stay in Daniel's again."
47192,153126,13-12-2010,189876,Markus,"All in all a very positive experience. Everything is just as he describes in his profile - a very clean, neat and cozy place with nice views across London, a very comfortable and large bed and kitchen with all amenities at ones disposal. The flat is within easy walking distance of Camden Lock Markets and tube station (Northern Line), and excellent public transport to Liverpool St and Regent St (24hr bus service) right outside his house. Daniel is very friendly and helpful, knows heaps about the area and has lots of info about everything you need to know and to enjoy your stay in London. I have absolutely no hesitation in recommending you to stay at his place. Do not hesitate to contact me if you you would like further information. "
47192,155389,18-12-2010,276917,Ian,"I enjoyed my stay with Daniel, in his immaculate and well designed flat. I had plenty of room, a delightful bed in which I had my best nights sleep in a long time, and teh best shower, (once I had learnt how to use it) that I have ever had in England. We Brits I think don't like pressure, especially water pressure.<br/><br/>Access to the apt., is easy, (once again when past the learning curve), and is a doodle of a walk from Camden Town Tube station.<br/><br/>I would very happily stay with Daniel again, and heartily recommend him.<br/><br/>IanY"
47192,165072,04-01-2011,282244,Linda,"Daniel was very nice, clean and helpful. He always had coffee ready if we wanted it. His apt was very secure..had like 3 locks to get thru the door. <br/><br/>The bathroom was small. Sink had hot and cold water faucets separated so there was no way to get warm water - it was either hot or cold spouts. Shower was like a regular bathtub size. Had to take baths b/c you couldn't hook the showerhead to the wall. His water tank could only have a certain amount of hot water so we had to conserve the hot water by taking baths - ie wet yourself, turn off water, scrub and wash you hair, turn water back on to wash everything off and complete.<br/><br/>The room was a good size. We had issues with the wi-fi connection but overall it worked ok..signal would be low a lot. <br/><br/>Location was great. Near Camden Town tube, Camden Market and Sainsbury (local food store)."
47192,180429,10-02-2011,265189,Chris,"I stayed 5 weeks at Daniels.<br/><br/>- Camden Town is a lively area<br/><br/>- Tube station is 10 minutes by walk - bus stop 1 minute<br/><br/>- supermarket is 5 minutes by walk<br/><br/>- he offered me to show me the area<br/><br/>- he gave me some magazines about London and Camden<br/><br/>- flat was very tidy and clean, well decorated<br/><br/>- it smelled heavily like incense sticks because he used them everywhere in the flat (except my room) <br/><br/>- he offered me to wash my clothes<br/><br/>- he asked me me when I have to go up in order to set the timer for the heating.<br/><br/>- heating was on for two hours a day<br/><br/>- doors had to be closed to save the warmth. Additionally I removed the blanket which was wrapped around the heating in order to improve its circulation.<br/><br/>- hot water boiler was on for one hour a day<br/><br/>- sometimes there was not enough warm water to shower<br/><br/>- room looked exactly like illustrated on the photos except the balloony ceiling light. - There was no ceiling light in the room, there were only passive lights and a desk light.<br/><br/>- Daniel sometimes had to go into my room to use his closet<br/><br/>- He was at home almost always.<br/><br/>- Bed sags in the middle. it was worn.<br/><br/>- Desk was loose and waggled heavily<br/><br/>- Often when Daniel was sleeping, or even sometimes when he was on the go, he turned off the wifi router. Thus by night and in the morning there was often no internet. Also I always had to turn off my computer or at least my wifi connection before he wanted to go online because of network problems.<br/><br/>- Once I had to leave the flat in the afternoon because he needed space for his own to practice.<br/><br/>- Garbage like packages or food glasses had to be cleaned in the washbasin before recycled in the appropriate rubbish bin.<br/>"
47192,185415,21-02-2011,311166,Cornelius,"I really enjoyed my stay at his place! it was clean, tidy and he is a very good host. the room is good and i loved the bed! he gave us loads of information on london. every morning there was fresh brewed coffee in the kitchen.<br/>altogether i had a beautiful first stay in london. - thank you daniel"
47192,198332,14-03-2011,364608,Michael,"We had a great time at Daniel's place. I can only recommend it for London trips. <br/>Everything was just perfect. Great location, very clean apartment and a very friendly host, who is sharing great information about interesting spots in London.<br/>Thanks and see you next time Daniel!"
47192,206576,22-03-2011,213341,Tjk,"Exactly as advertised - the apartment was a clean, neat and practical base in the heart of London. As host, Daniel was friendly and welcoming. I had a great time at Daniel's place and would thoroughly recommend this apartment.  "
47192,212753,29-03-2011,460014,Michael,"My stay with Daniel was nothing short of amazing. After contacting him just a day prior to our arrival he was quick to respond and made sure we had all the information we needed to get from the airport to his place. Once there we were greeted with the most charming of flats in a super convenient part of London. His apartment is close to the Northern line which makes it a breeze to go out exploring most of London and is even two stops away from King Cross for short day trips. Daniel, himself, is vibrant, full of life and a joy to talk to. I already miss our morning conversations. I can't recommend staying with him enough."
47192,217081,04-04-2011,443251,Patrick,"I am a frequent London traveler and I had selected Daniel's place for its great location. As I love my early morning run before starting the day I particularly liked its location nearby Hyde Park and its closeness to the centre through the Northern Line just around the corner. When I booked it,  I was not aware of the authenticity and liveliness of the neighborhood so that was great bonus on top. <br/>Daniel was a great host and his flat is very cosy and extremely clean (just as you can already see from his pictures). You can feel that Daniel truly wants his guests to feel at home. In my case he was so kind to join me for my morning run and to take me to the most enjoyable sites along the canal and the best corners of the parks. <br/>I will spend more weekends in London this years and Daniel will definitely see me again then...  "
47192,224699,12-04-2011,468424,Olga,"Place is great, just as described in the ad. Clean, safe and centrally located and short walk to the tube station. Daniel is very nice and helpful. I would recommend staying here. Can't beat the price. Cheers!"
47192,228149,16-04-2011,64155,Bud,"Daniel was a wonderful host, and his apartment is exactly as shown in the photographs-  very clean, modern and stylish. The flat is in a very funky neighbourhood, and Daniel was able to help me use the public transit that is located just a minute's walk away. I would highly recommend staying here!"
47192,230908,18-04-2011,165331,Shakir,Daniel picked me up from Camden Town station and was very understanding even though I changed my arrival time thrice! The room was large and comfortable and I enjoyed chatting with Daniel.
47192,241160,26-04-2011,421027,Nadja,"A nice room, not so large but quite and comfortable.  Greate that we could use kitchen to have a breakfast. We've got a lot of privacy - Daniel is very hospitable, discrete and helpfull to find ways around. Camden is a perdect area to stay -  a lot of nice restaurants, beautiful park, chanal and a busy market life...and very close to the London center. Thank you , Daniel, from Nadja and Steen"
47192,267819,17-05-2011,443251,Patrick,"Was great to be back last weekend. I would just like to confirm my earlier review. Daniel has a feel for making guests 'come home' at his flat... ;-) <br/>I am already looking forward to my next stay in a few weeks."
47192,271294,19-05-2011,191588,Courtney,"Daniel was a great host. I booked the room and then promptly lost internet connectivity for the next three days :(. But despite my communication fumbles, he was a gracious host and guide. He met me at the tube station and pointed out everything in the neighborhood. The room was neat and well designed, and the bed was so comfortable. The apartment was totally secure, and even had a keyed lock on the bedroom door, though I never felt compelled to use it. This is a great place for a solo traveler in London, and this is the first time I've used airbnb for anything other than renting an entire property. Felt totally secure and looked after as a female traveling alone. If the situation calls for it, I would definitely stay at Daniel's again.<br/>"
47192,289752,31-05-2011,143895,Francine,"Central London and Daniel- Very convenient location- felt very safe even when I came back alone at 1.30AM. Very clean, comfortable and quiet accommodation .Now let’s talk about the real deal- Daniel- What a respectful person! He will give you all the privacy you want . However, don’t be shy! Knock on his door- Have a chat with him. He is intelligent-interesting-creative- artistic. Share your experience. Staying in a B&B….isn’t it what it should be all about? Thank you Daniel for opening your door and a bit of your heart to me.<br/>You have a friend in Montreal!<br/>Francine XX<br/>"
47192,306851,10-06-2011,150273,Muira,"Daniel's an incredibly creative soul, willing to talk about almost any aspect of British or European culture.  He has a lovely flat that is perfect for one guest.  It's also located conveniently near the Camden Town underground station (and thus - also the Northern Line).  So - in terms of location - it is ideal. "
47192,311593,13-06-2011,578532,Gail,"I stayed in London for 3 nights in June. The place was exactly as pictured; super clean and very comfortable. <br/><br/>Daniel is a superb host; never hesitating to give directions to the transit system and sharing stories about the area. I absolutely would stay there again next time I travel to London. <br/><br/>The area was filled with a lot of young people and is a couple minutes away from the Camden Market and about a 5 minute walk to the Camden Town underground station on the Northern Line. Super easy to get around from there. <br/><br/>Thank you Daniel for being such a wonderful and accomodating host! Hope to see you soon. "
47192,319013,17-06-2011,550611,Karin,"Prospective guests: this room is great value for money, in a fabulous location, and boasts an amazing view of London. The room itself feels spacious and is very comfortable. The bedroom is actually Daniel's, but he sleeps in the second bedroom/living room while he hosts guests. Use of kitchen and free wifi is very useful.<br/><br/>Daniel is a very friendly, welcoming and easy-going host. From the moment he collected us from Camden Town we felt at ease in his presence. He gives a brisk and thorough view of the apartment allowing you to feel at home immediately. Be sure to invite him along to dinner, because we did and were treated to great stories and pleasant conversation. Thank you Daniel for a wonderful stay. We definitely recommend this room. "
47192,326169,21-06-2011,443251,Patrick,Was great to be back at Daniel's place. Felt a bit like coming home abroad. What else can one wish from a B&B... ;-)

A nice room, not so large but quite and comfortable. We've got a lot of privacy - Daniel is very hospitable, discrete and helpfull to find ways around. Camden is a nice area to stay - has got a lot of different restaurants, the chanal and a busy market life...and is close to the London center.

47192,440875,13-08-2011,602765,Charles,Daniel was a very good host. The photos and description of his place were accurate. I appreciated very much that Daniel kept the accomodations very clean. Daniel also took the time to explain the local area. My friend stayed the initial night and she was very impressed with Daniel's art. Thank you very much. 
47192,492089,01-09-2011,514929,Michael,I had a wonderful stay in Camden ! Daniel is an excellent host who made it a point to always check how everything was going. The room is larger than most and it is only a very short walk from Camden markets and the tube. You can get buses close by to take you to a wide variety of places and Leicester Square takes only about 20 minutes. A geat find. Thanks again Daniel.
47192,528372,13-09-2011,60570,Daniel,"Staying at Daniel's flat was a good experience. The location is but a short walk from a major tube stop, and was generally convenient to most everything in the city. Daniel picked me up at the tube, showed me around the neighborhood, and was incredibly helpful throughout my stay. <br/><br/>The flat itself is fastidiously maintained, and I'm not sure I have every stayed in a cleaner flat! That being said, Daniel is definitely a stickler for tidiness, so something to consider. The room itself has everything you need, and the bed was quite comfortable. The flat is very small, and thus, there's not much privacy, particular with just one bathroom. <br/><br/>Over all, an INCREDIBLE value for the money and a pleasant place to stay. "
47192,565308,25-09-2011,951658,Antonio,"Daniel is a great host! The room (all the flat, for that matter) was absolutely comfortable and clean. Above this, Camden Town is a really nice place to stay - it's easy to reach any part of London by bus or tube, and within walking distance you'll find Camden Market, Regent's Park, Primrose Hill, many good restaurants and pubs... highly recommended."
47192,589089,02-10-2011,828709,Deborah,"Daniel was the perfect host - friendly, easy to talk to, caring and genuine! The flat was in a great location and had a fantastic view - almost like you were floating above the hustle and bustle of Camden Town. The room was spacious and that bed was super comfy! You won't regret staying here! Good luck with the rooftop garden, Daniel - we think it'll be spectacular!"
47192,607032,07-10-2011,1185426,Kimberley,"Daniel is an excellent host, very friendly and hospitable. I was there looking for places to live and Daniel was full of information and advice.

47192,646973,20-10-2011,207620,Brian,"Hi!  I stayed with Daniel for one week.  It worked out very well.  Daniel is a great host.  He is kind and quiet, and always offers help in your days journey.  He's an interesting mate, and should you get to know him, he is funny and opinionated.  The apartment is wonderful.  Great location with plenty of restaurants and grocery options.  A very clean apartment.  And a great place to retreat from the bustling London.  Transportation is good, just a short walk to everywhere.  I highly recommend staying with Daniel."
47192,656068,23-10-2011,1280246,Camilla,"I had a great time staying at Daniel's for two nights. Great location, especially if you've never been in London and around Camden. 10 mins walk to tube (Northern Line). Good double bed and wifi. Great value and Daniel was very helpful and friendly. The flat is small but then again you're not in London to stay in:-). Great for solo traveller."
47192,682691,01-11-2011,1301065,François-Guillaume,"I went to London from Paris for work, and opted for an airbnb accommodation while going apartment hunting. Daniel's apartment came on top on searches for having both excellent (justified) recommendations while being quite cheap to its peers. Furthermore Camden Town is still a central location and very nice for bars, and famous for its markets.<br/>Daniel's apartment is bright, south facing, and very clean... (leave it clean or Daniel will be angry, he puts a lot of effort into it !!!) only 5mns to the station and to a huge Sainsbury's I guess its the best value in London for airbnb !! Daniel's said he's already considering raising prices !!!<br/>Thanks for your hospitality Daniel !"
47192,691871,04-11-2011,1217300,Laura,"Daniel is sweet, helpful, charismatic and kind--the perfect host! My friend Natalie and I had a wonderful stay, all thanks to Daniel and his lovely apartment. Prior to our arrival, he was great at communicating and was always quick to respond to any questions I had. Daniel met us at the station and when we arrived at the flat, he even made us tea and gave us great ideas for things to do in London. He was very helpful and was always there to give directions about getting around on the bus and tube.  Couldn't have asked for a better host and stay in Camden Town. It's a safe, lively and fun neighborhood with a ton of stores and bars.  As for transportation, there are several bus lines down the block and the metro is a short walk from the flat. For midnight snacks we also took advantage of Sainsbury's, the massive supermarket a block away.  The flat is warm, clean (we really appreciated this), has an amazingly cozy and big bed, every room was well-decorated with his art and most of all, it truly felt like a temporary home away from home. (As 2 college students on fall break, it was exactly what we needed!) As particular as we girls can be, we have absolutely nothing bad to say except that we wished we could have stayed longer! Thank you again Daniel!!!"

Daniel met us at the tube and helped us get around greater London.  His accommodations are very clean and very comfortable. My fiancé and I slept as if we were home because of Daniel's wonderful king size and comfortable bed.  Beyond that and more importantly we had the pleasure of becoming friends with Daniel.  He is friendly, gracious and intelligent.  We paid for a comfortable room and got a tour guide and educator to help us enjoy London more.  Thank you Daniel!  We already plan on staying with you the next time we visit London.  "

Daniel is funny and  hospitable person. we stay very well and we recommend it ."
47192,862223,14-01-2012,1482536,Charlie,Daniel was a fantastic host!  He helped me to get acclimated to the neighborhood. Even went with me to purchase my oyster card and explain how it works.  The best thing he did for me was teach me how to use buses rather then the tube.  It's cheaper and as you drive you are able to see the city.  The place itself was centrally located and the room was clean and very comfortable.  I loved talking to him and will definitely keep in touch and someday stay there again.
47192,873724,20-01-2012,1601728,Claudia,Daniel was a great host. He responded almost immediately to all my messages and questions and picked me up from the tube station at night.

Will definitely recommend him and will stay there in the future when I go back to London.
47192,895162,31-01-2012,678017,Brett,"I stayed a second time on a return trip to London. In my last review I don't think I mentioned how great the location is, near the best bits of Camden, but away from the street noise."
47192,949495,26-02-2012,1693161,Philippe,"Daniel's flat is very well located, just a few minute walk from famous and vibrant Camden neighbourhood and from Camden Town tube station. Only two tube stops from St-Pancras railway station and Eurostar terminal. Several bus routes nearby. Easy and quick to get to central London and all other areas of the city.<br/>Although the room is a bit small and has just enough space to eat or to use a laptop, the king size bed is really comfortable, and the view from the 6th floor window is just amazing! We had little time with Daniel, but even so we could enjoy his company. He was a caring and respectful host. He came and picked us up at the tube station, then welcomed us at his place with fresh coffee! <br/>The flat is not large but functional, very clean and pleasant, with a modern and colourful decoration, including candles and Daniel's own paintings. The flat is more than suitable for people like us spending most of their daytime outside and looking mostly for a nice place to sleep at night. <br/>We would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend Daniel's place."
47192,980674,07-03-2012,1684598,Alessandro,"Daniel is great host. He gave me a wonderfully warm welcome and he was really comfortable sharing his space. The neighborhood is quiet, but well connected. I would thoroughly recommend staying here.<br/>(Alex, Febrary 2012) <br/>"

Daniel thought of everything from a power converter, hair dryer, space in the fridge, and offerred me coffee everymorning. Upon my arrival, Daniel gave me a tour of the space and took me on a walk to Primrose Hill to orient me to the neighborhood. The apartment is beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and the bed is amazing. The building is less than 10 min walk to the tube and buses. Near many restaurants, shops, etc. I plan to return again and stay with Daniel in the future."

47192,1096483,08-04-2012,1696946,Attila,"We stayed with Danny for 3 nights just before Easter and had a fabulous time. The flat is small but very pretty and tidy, with a really comfy bed and good self-catering facilities. It's just minutes from the underground and several useful bus lines that we enjoyed taking to the city centre. Danny picked us up from the underground and told us a lot about the area and what it's like living in Camden, which we found very interesting. He's very amicable and helpful and we'd definitely recommend this place to anyone! Hope we can come back soon too :-)"

He picked me up from tube station and help with my luggage as well as walked me when i was leaving. The apartment is immaculately clean and neat,  filled with great energy.  The bed is the most comfortable bed i was sleeping during my whole trip in Europe and trust me, i slept in many beds lol. I enjoyed staying in Danny's apartment, his morning brewed coffee as well as chitchatting with him about art/culture/travel. Love the location and building.<br/> Danny! Thank you again for all your help and letting me stay in your apartment. Wish i could have more time to spent with you as i know you are a very interesting person. Hope to see you again! Thank you! Namaste!"
47192,1196197,29-04-2012,198796,Jessica,"Danny's apartment is in a great location and is very comfortable. The water pressure in the shower is great and I loved the pillows!  Danny was also incredibly nice. He walked with us to Primrose Hill and when he learned our next stop was in Brussels, he offered us a guide book and a lot of good advice.  I have always been a bit directionally challenged and Danny gave great directions and often pointed things out from his window (great view) to make sure I knew where I was going.  Great experience! "
47192,1220569,03-05-2012,1660999,Robert,"If you like it cozy, centrally located, friendly and clean, stay at Daniel. His flat is located in Camden Town which is a really good location for discovering London.You are quickly at all the sightseeing spots or in the supposedly cool spots in town. The apartment is close to the tube and some buses head for central London just one street away. It´s small, but very cozy, very clean and with a nice view on the town being on the 6th floor. Due to the size of the apartment you have ample contact with Daniel who is a very pleasant guy to stay with: extremely helpful, a good and knowledgeable company and eager to make ones stay as pleasant as possible. If you want to really live with somebody and not just rent a room, Daniel´s place is the one. We liked it this way and can recommend him as a host and his flat without any reservation! "

Cuando vuelva a Londres no dudare en hospedarme nuevamente en su casa."

47192,1409627,04-06-2012,1859945,Olivia,"I had a nice stay at Danny's.  He met me at the tube station and then once I was settled, walked back into Camden with me and showed me where the bus station was and places where I could eat.  I didn't feel that safe walking back from Camden Station or around the apartment, but there are always a lot of people around and everything is well lit which helps.  Danny was fine with me using his kitchen which was nice.  Sometimes I found it a little hard to sleep as the area is a little noisy."
47192,1436856,08-06-2012,2107377,Bárbara,"The stay in this room was great. Danny is a very acomodating host and went to the tube station to pick me up.

47192,1555036,25-06-2012,1396251,Ruth,"Danny was a wonderful host and we loved being so close to busses and trains. He cheerfully met us after a late arrival, recommended activities, and although we actually spent a small amount of time at the apartment, his home was a welcoming spot to return to. A great alternative to hotels, as he's a long-time resident of the city/neighborhood. We felt safe, cared for, and would endorse him as a stellar host."
47192,1593937,30-06-2012,2337619,Gina,"We had a great time in Camden Town at Danny's flat. His place is immaculate and a pleasure to spend time in. We went to London to see a concert at the Jazz Cafe which is just up the street from Danny's and couldn't believe the area. It has the best markets, transport system and great local bars.<br/>Around the corner is Amy Winehouse's local pub & house, one of the last punk pubs in London and the original Doc Martin shoe shop. The local canal system is just beautiful and the view from Primrose Hill is wonderful.<br/>Danny's place is a great place to stay to get the feel of the London hussle and energy.<br/>Danny is a fantastic host who wants his visitors to enjoy his neighbourhood and London. He is a wonderful host and is very proud of the time and effort he has put into his groovy little flat.<br/>I would recommend Danny and his flat to anyone who wants to stay in the centre of London.<br/>Thank you Danny having us in your home."

It is very clean, bright, cozy, quiet (even though it’s close to the Camden Market) and the bedroom is super comfortable. I slept as well as at home! Daniel picked me up at the tube station and showed me the area so that I wouldn’t get lost. It wasn’t my first time in London but thanks to Daniel and his 23 years in London I’ve discovered many places I’ve never been before. The area is safe and Camden is a good location to stay. I would highly recommend Daniel’s accommodation for anyone who wants to discover London in a different way. Daniel is a very interesting person, helpful, who is really taking care of his host. Again, thank you very much Daniel! (I miss our talks!)"

Daniel is a super-open, friendly, funny guy who I hope to stay in touch with. We did a few things together, some great conversation, a meal out & a lovely walk up Primrose Hill which is not too far from the flat with great views over London. Lots of transport very close by, lots of places to eat, cheap & otherwise, Camden Town markets minutes away - it's all happening!  I spent a lot of time in the galleries & museums & it was so easy to get to everywhere, loved the buses, obviously slower than the underground but you get to see the place. My only problem was that I didn't have enough time in London - coming back soon!"

The apartment is a 5 min walk from the tube and 2 mins from the bus, and the area is very well lit, which helps when coming back late at night.<br/><br/>There are plenty of funky restaurants, pubs, and shops nearby (as well as a supermarket and pharmacies), plus the vibrant Camden market, and you're a short tube/bus ride to the rest of central London. Perfect location.<br/><br/>I honestly can't say enough about how wonderful Daniel was as a host and how comfortable and welcoming his flat is.

Also he gave us many tips about not so obvious places to go.<br/>Daniel picked us up at the tube station when we arrived, and welcomed us with tea and Belgian waffles. All through our stay he made Eigil (9 years old) feel welcome and at home in a gentle and non-pushy way. Myself, I enjoyed some good conversations about both bigger and smaller aspects of life ;-)<br/>Daniels place was clean and orderly, in a style very much to my liking. Five stars from here!<br/>"

The room is as presented on the pictures, tastefully decorated and with a comfy bed, slightly elevated to provide extra storage room (there is also a small fridge). I was very impressed at how cleverly Dino managed to make use of the flat's space (he's an architect and it shows)!<br/>The flat is very centrally located, with bus stops and the tube within a 5-minute walk. Shops are also in the proximity of the flat. Still, despite its central location, the flat is very quiet, all I heard in the morning with an open window were the birds chirping away - I got some good nights' sleep!<br/>Dino is friendly, polite and caring, and will give you all the information you need to explore London or find the best suitable transport connection. He sometimes works from home and may need to keep to himself during those times but was nonetheless always forthcoming and available to help.<br/>In the morning I always had fresh coffee waiting for me and we had some great chats. I really enjoyed his company and would not hesitate to be back! Thank you!"

47192,32425217,17-05-2015,32676539,Claire,Dino is the most warm and welcoming host. The description is completely accurate except it doesn't mention the beautiful view. The room is lovely and location is ideally centrally placed.
47192,32894512,23-05-2015,7096473,Sandra,"Three things you should know about Dino's:<br/>1. Location is the best - Central London is at your doorstep. Great Portland and Russel Street Tubes, or Regent's Park are a 5 minute walk. Warren Street Tube a 10-minute walk. Walk to Oxford Circus in 20. Or hop on the 88 bus for a scenic ride Westminster Abbey, or the 27 bus to South Kensington.<br/>2. Dino is a great host - Dino is warm, friendly, and welcoming. He made me coffee, gave me a Tube Map. We talked about life, and I am grateful he took time to watch my son's violin recital at nearby Royal Academy of Music. <br/>3. Dino's flat is all you need - Your 10th floor penthouse accommodation will be clean and comfortable. Your room faces West overlooking scenic Regent's Park and wonderful sunsets. "

47192,33763054,01-06-2015,22974287,Mary,"The room is very close to central London and of course Regent's Park. It's location makes it good value. The apartment itself is on the top floor of a building that is part of a large housing estate and the immediate area is lively. The apartment itself however is very quiet. The room is compact, with a single but very comfortable bed, on a small mezzanine up a small stepladder. The room has everything you can need and has a nice view.  The apartment is spotlessly keen and Dino is a fastidious host. If you are in London when it is on try and see a show at the Outdoor Theatre at Regent's Park, (and Dino thank you for lending me your binoculars.)"
47192,34135460,05-06-2015,6465178,Ricardo,"If it's your first time in London, stay at Dino's.<br/>If you've been before and you want to visit the city again, stay at Dino's. Believe me, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>He lives in a pretty cool and comfortable floor very near Camden Town. It's really easy to get there since it's very well connected, with at least three tube stations just a few blocks away, so you won't get lost. Plus there is a train station if you plan to visit another city.<br/><br/>And of course Dino: he'll make yourself feel at home. He will make sure you have a great time in both London and his home. We had some really nice conversations about this and that.<br/><br/>I had a great experience, so i totally recommend him as host. If im coming back to London anytime soon, for sure he'll be my first alternative.<br/><br/>Tip: have a morning coffee in the terrace and enjoy the view."

I appreciated the care Dino took to make me feel at home, from the cleanliness, to the invitation to share his morning coffee, to the advice about places to visit and things to do. The apartment is spotless and the attention to things like a way to indicate when the bathroom is occupied, or which plate ware to use are all designed to avoid any feeling of awkwardness that one may have  when sharing another's home. <br/>The next time I travel to London I will try to book with Dino again. By the time I left I felt as if I had been staying with a friend. <br/>Highly recommended!"
47192,34934644,14-06-2015,17423111,Eve,"Dino and his place are two of the best things you'll find in London. Dino is charming and helpful; his place is perfect for a stay in London. It is nearby transportation - bus and the Tube, and the neighborhood offers the comforts of a grocery, restaurants, and a post office. I would totally recommend Dino's place to a friend and when I return to London, I will return to Dino's place. Dino supplied coffee every a.m. and in the evening too, which is so nice.

I even wished I was staying there longer. <br/>The room does not have extra rooms I can walk around or anything, but everything that one would need was in the room. Very space efficient. The view from the bed was quite amazing. <br/>Dino is the most friendly and professional person I have ever met. He was a good company for good conversations, and the place is filled with his artistic talents. The place is also very very well organized and clean. The variety of pillows and cushions will bring you the most pleasant rest while you are tired from travelling. <br/><br/>I can't stop complimenting.

He was very patient and understanding as I came back to his place late at night once and could not open the door - so he woke up in the middle of the night and let me in. We had nice chats, however, I did spend a lot of time in the city, trying to discover the real London so we could have used some more time to talk about interesting topics. He generously lent his map, gave advice and offered help whenever I needed. The flat is very clean, neat and organized, and I liked its artistic vibe. The room is small but very comfortable, everything you need is there. The flat is well located, you can reach the most important spots even on foot from there.<br/>I would highly recommend to stay at Dino's place to anyone !"
47192,48273020,25-09-2015,14457388,Kazuhide,"Dino was very kind of me. Since it was my first travel to London, he guided me about the location including the nearest station, the shopping and the sightseeing area on the first day. It was very helpful for me. <br/><br/>The home is located near from the beautiful regent's park and I enjoyed running in the morning. The area is calm and a safe place to live. I could spend very precious time in London. <br/><br/>"
47192,49419265,04-10-2015,30634625,Jen,The apartment locates in central london that's 5-10 minutes walk to major sight seeing places.

You will find Dino is a good companion to stay and it's really a pleasant stay there.

47192,50439506,12-10-2015,37746795,Cheryl,"Dino met me at the apartment block door and carried my rather heavy suitcase. He made me feel very welcome - like a friend coming to stay. Dino gave me a thorough rundown of his flat so that I knew where everything was and how it worked which was great. He was thoughtful and caring and was there to help with whatever I needed. The thing I loved most about Dino was his organisation. Everything you needed was where it should be, worked and if there was something extra it appeared immediately. Dino's flat is fantastic - decor and position. I loved the view of the London skyline from my bedroom window. Thanks for making my stay in London memorable, Dino. See you next time!!<br/>"
47192,50740346,14-10-2015,4435902,Rica,"Dino was friendly and helpful. He gave me a walking tour of the neighborhood, lent maps, and gave important info. Place was small, spic and span, spotless. Beautifully renovated with hip colorful accents.  Location is quite good, if you like to walk. Not so far from major train stations.  Few blocks away from tube stations.  Quiet safe area. Free coffee, tea, biscuits.  Room is tiny, neat. I loved the colour palette. No TV. Wifi. Lots of beautiful books on travel. Bed is high and right next to window."
47192,50954162,16-10-2015,20525596,Mike,"Dino met me at the entrance to the building before showing me to the flat.  He explained everything in the flat clearly and offered a coffee.

The maps were really useful as was his knoweldge of the local transport system. <br/><br/>Dino is firendly and chatty and very easy to get on with. The apartment is very clean and has a pleasant view over the London skyline. The room may be small but it's very well organised and there is lot sof space to store luggage and your personal belongings. <br/><br/>He goes the extra mile making you feel at home and even got up early to say goodbye when I leaft for an early flgiht (sorry about  that Dino!)<br/><br/>I would recommened this room to anyone wanting to visit London on tourism or on business.

He sent me several messages and emailed in the lead up to my stay. He made sure he organised to be home when I arrived, and he took time to show me his place, and gave me great advice about London, with the use of maps. He also offered me coffee, which was much appreciated.<br/>The place is as advertised. A small single room, fully equipped with a small desk, lights, bookshelves, drawers. The bed is warm and comfortable. I had full access to the bathroom and kitchen, which had all the necessary amenities.<br/>The location is great!

I can say now having stayed for two nights, that it was all warranted.<br/>Dino was an absolutely terrific host from start to finish and I found his space exceptionally clean, quiet and comfortable.  <br/>Beyond the stay itself..  I really appreciated Dino taking time to familiarize me with the area, show me around neighbouring Regent's Park and offer some great city insight...  The kind only a local would possess.  <br/>I wouldn't hesitate booking with Dino again or recommending his listing to friends or travellers.<br/>Final note.  Be sure to read his profile.

The room is small but completely fine, with a raised bed and large window. I had some troubles with the keys/locks but Dino was kind enough to let me in late at night. Just make sure you are clear on how these all work prior to leaving the apartment. Dino was sociable and kind, making for a good stay."

He is a welcoming, friendly host with lots of good information about the neighborhood (and also an excellent conversationalist). His place was well organized and very tidy.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that the room is pretty compact. Wasn't an issue for me. I kind of liked the efficiency of the space, which had a very nice interior. Ask Dino to show old pictures of the place, he did a massive amount of work to remodel and reorganize everything just the way he wanted it."

47192,59581525,12-01-2016,50766929,Jimmy,The room at Dino's was exactly as described and everything was in good condition. The location is an ideal spot for exploring London. The space is very compact but fine for what you need. Dino is more than accommodating and  gives great insight what to do around the city. The only minor fault is that the wifi does not work while laying down in bed.
47192,59848600,16-01-2016,29492029,David,Dino is a great host and is rightly proud of his beautifully designed apartment. I enjoyed  our conversations.

47192,61022718,31-01-2016,40056316,Jenna,"I was so glad to stay with Dino for my few days visit to London; my first. It was only my second stay through Airbnb, and I was not disappointed. Despite getting confused about what time I was actually arriving in the city, Dino accommodated me and came out to find me in the rain when I was trying to find his building!<br/><br/>His flat is excellently renovated in a modern, clean look, and you can see all of his personal touches throughout, in the design and decor. I enjoyed a glass of mulled wine with Dino on the first and last nights, and every morning he had fresh coffee ready to go in the French press. He also spent a significant amount of time poring over the map with me to help guide me in the right direction so I could get to all the places I wanted to see on my visit, and suggested walking routes for the best views of parks, etc. He even walked me out to the main road my first night to find food and the grocery, etc. The bed is comfortable, and has ample blankets and pillows, and the room heats up quite nicely at night. If you require lots of extra space for your luggage or more room to move about, perhaps for an extended trip, it may not be the place for you. But I loved it for my short, cozy stay.<br/><br/>Dino is a fastidiously clean host, and takes a great deal of pride in his flat and his guests' accommodations. There's nothing to complain about here -- things were neat, water was hot and high pressure, and Dino looks after his guests' comfort and safety. I had a great time talking with him about all sorts of things, from his art, to travel, politics, and more. Thank you Dino, for making my first trip to London so smooth!"
47192,61549749,06-02-2016,5240602,Nicole,The listing was very accurate and the flat was perfect for the work I needed to do at the British Library. Nice time chatting with Dino!

Very convenient location, walking distance to Warren Street Tube Station and only a slightly further walk to Euston Station and Kings Cross St Pancras Stations which made it very easy to get around London and also travel outside of London. Dino is a friendly and polite host."
47192,64589909,06-03-2016,30953604,Jade,"I really enjoyed the stay at Dino's place.<br/>Everything was perfect: the warm welcome of Dino, his availability to help, the cosy room, the colorful kitchen, the clean bathroom, Regent park...<br/>only simple wish: I do hope  to stay again for my next trip to London<br/>"
47192,65062574,10-03-2016,32974621,Ying,"Dino is a very nice host. Everything in the flat is extremely organized and clean. Dino know the city and is very happy to share his experience. The only flaw is that wifi signal is week in my room. But since I didn't spend much time indoor, it's not a big deal."
47192,65544996,15-03-2016,10724292,Juan Paolo,"I stayed at Dino's place last March for about 5 days. It was a very pleasant experience. The location was great, the apartment was clean, the bed was comfortable, and Dino was a lovely company. He was very helpful and friendly. The apartment's location was walkable to Soho (~15-20mins), Camden (~15-20mins), and Regent's park (~5mins). This is still in Zone 1 so almost all places are accessible via a short train ride. You don't waste time on commute. The room is not big but that wasn't a problem for me. It doesn't feel claustrophobic at all. The space is functional. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this place. If I end up in London again, I will definitely stay at Dino's place again."
47192,66387026,22-03-2016,29147638,Jill,Dino provided very detailed instructions to get to his flat. He explained everything very clearly on arrival and was very generous with his local knowledge and went out of his way to be helpful.

The room is compact and functional. The bed was comfortable and the view from the window was spectacular. Very convenient location, only a few minutes walk to Regent's Park and easy access to Great Portland and Warren Street Tube Stations.

Dino is someone who goes above and beyond to make his guests feel welcome in every single way, his impeccable manners outshine his awesome personality! His place is just fantastic being centrally located near Regent's Park with easy accessibility to local transport within a few minutes walk. Dino's whole apartment is clean, tidy, bright and above the rooftops of London with magnificent views all around :-)<br/>The guestroom is equipped with one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in and there is enough space to fit your luggage, hangers provided for your clothing and even EU adapters for your charging devices. The WiFi works extremely well and I've said it before and will say it again: this is really a 10-star airbnb experience unlike any other with the bestest of hosts a guest can wish for ...!!! I'm already counting the days until I'm staying again with Dino in June :-)"
47192,70389318,17-04-2016,65757671,Rico,Dino is a great host and has a wonderful small room close to the Regents Park to rent. Be prepared to have magnificent views over London! Always again!

47192,76303498,26-05-2016,62072706,Daniel,"I had a great experience staying with Dino. He was warm, welcoming, and very helpful. It was my first visit to London and he gave me great tips about places to go and how to get around town. The room was super clean as were the bathroom and kitchen. The location near Regent's Park was perfect. Very close to a tube station and a bus stop that made getting around easy, but also quiet and peaceful with a great view on a clear day. Dino also made me tea and fed me biscuits and chocolate. How can you ask for a better host than that? I would definitely stay with him again."

I hope to visit again soon."
47192,79148741,11-06-2016,52924215,Marcus,"Dino is a very considerate and attentive host. The flat is truly impressive - George Clarke would call it an Amazing Space - with fantastic views across the park, and Dino keeps it meticulously clean.  Very comfortable bed. I just needed a place to sleep, shower and eat breakfast before spending my days in the nearby British Library, and it proved perfect for that."

47192,80610830,19-06-2016,58701185,Michaela,"My stay at Dino's flat was great! The flat is in a fantastic location which allowed me to walk to the city centre in about half an hour. Even though I mostly walked everywhere, there are great links to public transport and there are also many shops nearby. The flat itself is located on a top floor so the view from my room (which was clean and cozy) was absolutely stunning. What is more, the bed is on a platform so I was able to enjoy the view from my bed which I absolutely loved.<br/>I would definitely consider staying in Dino's flat the next time I am in London and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to stay in central London with a very friendly host."
47192,80801661,19-06-2016,1100010,Iris,"Once again ... I came 'home' to one of AirBnB best places ever!!! Staying with Dino is being ""Home away from Home"", staying with a friend who has been ever so lovely, kind and cordial since the very first time I arrived, who goes out of his way to make his guests feel welcomed in every single way. Dino is always excellent in keeping in contact prior to, and during a trip. His location can't be beaten, within walking distance to Euston Station, Regent's Park and several bus stops right around the corner. The description is as accurate as it's showed on AirBnB: your own private room (with the most comfortable bed ever!) and everything extremely clean and tidy! Staying with Dino makes my trips to London worthwhile and I can't wait to be back real soon!!!"
47192,82036977,26-06-2016,53212429,Laura,"Great host great place! The room is small but cosy. The room has more than you need to live it. I love how cosy and warm the room was. Dino was a great host! I stayed a week and he even washed and hung up my clothes. Dino was great for recommendations and he was more than happy to help. Dino even loaned me a sandwich container while I was staying there. <br/>Dino was very patient with me too, I was having trouble locking the door and he took the time to show me how to do it again! <br/>The room is very quiet, and clean. It is in a great location and is easy to find. <br/>Honestly I do not have anything bad to say, I really enjoyed my stay and would stay there again in a heart beat."
47192,82641666,28-06-2016,78300947,Hymen,"Dino was very nice and tentative to my needs. The location is close to major bus stations and Warren St Tube Station. When i stayed in London, i basically walked everywhere."
47192,83885079,04-07-2016,14742718,Poul,"I stayed here for 6 days and had a very nice stay. Dino is a nice host. He is very helpful and does more that you would expect to give you a pleasant experience, like bringing bread from the nearby shop and doing the dishes for you.<br/>The room is small, but it works fine. It is a wonderful thing to wake up in the morning to a view over Regent Park. <br/>The area seems quiet, yet only few minutes from 3 tube stations and there's a bus stop right around the corner. And the room is at the top of the buiding, so it is very quiet.<br/>As I wrote, it's a small room, but so is the price. if you are looking for priceworthy place to stay, Dino's is very recommendable."
47192,87772301,21-07-2016,3100011,Sudev,"Dino is a wonderful host who gave me a very warm welcome when I arrived to London after a late night flight from New Delhi. His directions to the flat were clear and simple, and he walked to a nearby grocery store to purchase a simple dinner. I stayed with Dino for over two weeks, and the flat is a small but beautiful, clean, and convenient place to live while in London. Many major tourist attractions, libraries, and famous markets are walking distance from his place. <br/>Dino's flat is located on the top floor of a building, and the views and evening breeze are pleasant to enjoy. There is a fridge in the room, but you can also share the main fridge in the kitchen if that is convenient. Dino makes fresh coffee throughout the day, and that was a simple touch which made my stay all the more enjoyable. Dino was kind enough to also spend an entire day with me walking around London and showing me some of the favorite places the locals like to hangout. I will certainly stay at Dino's flat again during my subsequent visit to London. It is a charming home, and perfect for a single person (professional or student) who is out during the day and back in the evening to relax, rest, and sleep. For my fellow graduate students, it is convenient location for a 15 minute pleasant walk to the British Library."
47192,91602757,06-08-2016,22150784,Jessie,Dino is a wonderful host! The room is small but incredibly clean and well furnished. The location is so convient for Regents Park and central London. I walked to work on Oxford Street everyday. Dino is such a generous person. I'll be back!

47192,95162849,18-08-2016,27209332,Dan,Dino is an excellent Airbnb host. He spends the time to really explain how everything works in his apartment and is extremely knowledgable about places to visit in the local area. The room itself is very comfortable with the most amazing vista of the London skyline right outside the window. You can watch the sun go down over Regents Park which is pretty spectacular. It is an extremely quiet neighbourhood which means you can leave the window open the entire night and get a nice calm breeze flowing through which I like. The entire apparent is immaculate and 5 star hotel level clean. The bed is very comfortable and Dino has decorated and designed his home to a very high standard. I highly recommend Dino's place and I think Dino is a credit to the ethos of what Airbnb was set up to do often going above and beyond what a guest might expect.
47192,96795336,24-08-2016,28248093,Alejandro,"Dino was an incredible host. He was so friendly, good vibe person and always ready to help. I really recommend this stay if you really wanna have a great time in London with a super nice host. About the apartment, it's even better than the pics. Cozy and really comfy pretty close to everything. This place is a must if you are thinking about visiting London. "
47192,98232235,30-08-2016,21655063,Rachel,"Dino was an amazing host! He's friendly and welcoming, but is respectful of privacy.

The room is clean and has a wonderful view over Regent's Park. The price paid for the room was accurate given the location and facilities of the accommodation (bearing in mind the size of the room as detailed in the description on the website). Overall it was a good experience and I would definitely consider returning back to Dino's place. 
47192,104929017,29-09-2016,50811215,Miles,"Great place<br/>Great location<br/>Peaceful and comfortable stay<br/>Dino was very welcoming<br/>"

He communicated with me in advance, sending me details of the easiest way to arrive at his flat and spent time with me on my arrival explaining how everything in the flat worked.<br/>The room was exactly as detailed in the advert, small, very comfortable and with a fabulous view.  It's in a brilliant location to access Regent's Park.  A wonderful stay, thank you Dino."

47192,110465380,26-10-2016,96891152,Wilson,房間非常舒適，窗外風景優美。位置方便，只需要花五至十分鐘便到地鐵站，很容易便到達倫敦市內不同的景點。屋主十分友善，給了我很多很好的旅遊建議。

The spaces are quite small, but it was confortable for a few days. Dino is a friendly and very present person in case of need. "
47192,114163547,16-11-2016,13553863,Jackie,"I had a nice stay in Dino's place. Perfect for a couple of days exploring the city as a solo traveler. The location was great - close to 4 subway lines including the Victoria line, 3 buses to Soho, Picadilly Circus, etc. There are amenities right across from the building such as a small grocery store and bakery. Dino was a very friendly and helpful host. Lovely view. Wifi was a bit spotty at times. Thanks Dino!"
47192,120143521,08-12-2016,44724786,Iwona,"Dino is a great host! He is very hospitable, caring and willing to share his stories and time with the guest. We had a lovely walk into the Primrose  Hill and nice coffee at the Thames river. The apartment is perfectly located (zone 1) with a walking distance to almost all important places in the city and with a great access to the public transport. I do recommend Dino as a host you won’t regret staying at his place! ☺ All the best Dino and hope to see you again! "
47192,121990407,20-12-2016,103874664,Veronika,Dino is very polite and friendy host. It is one of the best hosts ever could be.
47192,125559411,06-01-2017,104981658,Jane,"Dino's place is really clean and organised. his explainations made it easier for me to keep everything the same as it should be. He is an experienced host. He is mild, easy going and kind. I enjoyed our long conversations very much because he is a person with experiences and life wisdom. He helped with me to move my luggages to bus stop on the day I leave. On my trip, for some personal reasons, I had to stay some days in hotel and some days in his place. But should I have an option, I prefer to stay at his place because of the interpersonal contact I can get there. Surely I will choose it on my next trips to London! "
47192,129147591,29-01-2017,15483451,Alexander,Dino was a pleasure to stay with - We talked about everything from art to startups. Room was clean and easy walking distance to Camden or Euston station. Would definitely stay again!

Quiet and safe location, close to public transport and underground.

Thanks Dino!"
47192,132694112,19-02-2017,5016196,Demelza,"I arrived at Dino's place a little early. Fortunately he was home to receive me. He came downstairs to receive me and to explain me the rules of the building and of the house. His flat is at the top floor of his building and it has a very nice view. Everything is tidy and clean.The place is conveniently located close to Euston train station and Warren Street underground station. There are several restaurants within a walking distance and the tube can get you everywhere in London. Dino is very nice and attentive to one's needs. He gives good advice regarding where to go and what means of transportation is more convenient. I would stay again with. Totally recommended.<br/>Kind regards,<br/>Edgar Duarte"

47192,141219361,02-04-2017,17749249,Stas,"Very good location just couple minutes from the beautiful Regent's Park. Apartment is on the top floor and it is like a mini penthouse. Be prepared that the room is very small, but Dino made the most out of the space using every millimeter. You have everything you need their and with gorgeous view at the park. Dino is very much about cleanness, so his place is cleaner than the operating (surgery) room. He is a very nice guy full of interesting stories. Ask him to show you his balcony and check out the beatiful garden he made their!"
47192,143099398,10-04-2017,9878166,Jose Alberto,Excelente. Dino es una persona con mucha sensibilidad y muy amable. Muy buena ubicación . Dino brinda excelentes detalles para llegar a su departamento.

Thanks Dino for a great visit!"

47192,155993010,29-05-2017,81994379,Miranda J.,"This was more like staying with a study abroad host family than staying at a B&B! :) If you're an inexperienced traveler, or teenager traveling abroad for the first time, this is the perfect place. Dino will check on you every morning and every evening. He'll worry about you if you're out late, remind you when to wear a jacket, give you free snacks and/or insist that you eat before you leave in the morning, and he'll make many suggestions about what you should be doing (even if you think you know what you're doing). Truly a hands-on host! He spent about half an hour each morning and each evening asking me about my plans and my day. Dino goes above and beyond -- he wants to experience your trip right alongside you! "
47192,157574357,04-06-2017,127712318,Mirko,"Dino is an experienced host, so you can't make a mistake by choosing his place. The room is small, but very well organized so you'll have everything you need for a comfortable stay. Dino is keeping his place very clean so that's a big plus. He knows London very well so he can give good tips what places you should visit in London. In my opinion, this is a great place to stay in London."
47192,159683722,11-06-2017,59039961,Anette,"This was my first experience with Airbnb, and it couldn't have been better. The location was perfect for me and I loved my little room with views over the top of Regents Park. You can tell that a lot of thought has gone into making the best use of a small space, and the result is cosy and comfortable. Staying there definitely enhanced a wonderful weekend in London. Dino is a very helpful, thoughtful and welcoming host, and just a really nice guy all around. Highly recommended!"
47192,162070171,19-06-2017,130430472,Lawrence,Dino is a responsible host and very helpful in providing a variety of information. His place is very clean and close to underground. A good place to stay when visit London.

47192,168292489,09-07-2017,10050637,Christine,"Dino's place is immaculate, cosy and delightful but very, very small. I really enjoyed my time there. Dino was extremely helpful even meeting me at the tube station at 11 pm on a Friday night. He was very welcoming and is very proud of his little abode. Rightly so. It is artistic and compact with great views.<br/>He was very knowledgable and helpful with information about London and public transport.<br/>I enjoyed conversation with Dino about many things. <br/>Thank you, Dino. I would definitely stay again. It was a pleasure to meet you and to stay in your place.<br/>"

Very helpful, informative and  respect full of one's privacy...plus a very interesting person to get to know. Close to everything that I was interested in and  easy walk to the tube and west end. A fairly small space, but very well designed, appointed and super clean!"
47192,188434880,29-08-2017,58747408,Ben,"Dino has one of the cleanest, quietest and most well-designed places in Central London - close to all the action, but super quiet in the evenings, beautifully designed and really well kept. Dino himself is a lovely, chatty host with a whole bunch of great life-experience, and although small, his flat has an incredible use of space. Fully recommend for any lone travellers!"
47192,191925821,09-09-2017,42019228,William,"Dino is a very kind host and did everything to made my stay in London perfect (he gave maps to me, advices to visit the city, ...). Chatting with him was also very pleasant. His flat is clean and well designed. I recommend without a doubt."

Dino is quite and polite and loves to make sure you needs are met. Take advantage of his knowledge of the area and life in London to get some helpful tips, insights and travel ideas."

47192,195120136,18-09-2017,39832652,Lena,"Dino was a great host, very welcoming, helpful and kind. You really feel like you're visiting a friend.<br/>And his place is just awesome - you're in a penthouse directly overlooking Regent Park - what's not to like! Don't cheat yourself of standing on the balcony during sunset, it's awesome.<br/>Everything is spotless clean, Dino takes care of his stuff and expect you to do the same - fair enough!<br/>BUT, note, when Dino says don't follow (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) maps and you think yeah-yeah, I'll find my way (...using (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN)), don't. <br/>All in all I give Dino my highest recommendations for a stay in London!"
47192,195889401,21-09-2017,29112185,Kerstin,Dino's place was as described and better. Beautiful view over Regents Park and while it is very small it has everything you need and is super clean. Very convenient location for the city and Camden Town and a lot cheaper and quieter than most other options. Would definitely stay again and recommend for single travelers that don't mind a small room and a chatty host ;) He has some amazing stories and is an inspiring person! Do talk to him when you're there (and look at his beautiful artwork).
47192,198361875,29-09-2017,137890172,Dan,Thank you Dino for hosting me! Your place is so central to everything London has to offer! Easy to reach! I loved the coziness of your home.

I look forward to returning back to London and stay with you again! Thanks again!  Dan

47192,210236619,08-11-2017,157001003,Rafael Orlandini,"Dino's place is just amazing. It's really well located and I couldn't ask for a better host on my first experience with Airbnb. Althought the room is small, it's really cozy and I've felt pretty good there. The flat is just beautiful and Dino's artworks are also one of a kind. If you're looking for a place easy to reach and a host that likes to chat and know everything about you and your day, Dino's flat is the perfect one."
47192,214695662,26-11-2017,54754807,Bret,Great space close to the very center of London. Perfect for my short trips to the city to just see theatre and have a place to sleep. Very comfortable room and would definitely recommend it.
47192,216902446,06-12-2017,158571742,Tim,Dino is a great host. His offered single bedroom is perfectly clean and has everything you need to spend the night after an exciting day in London. The flat is nicely located in the center of London close to a park. Dino is an experienced man and can help you with a lot of things. I can highly recommend to stay with him.
47192,217243062,08-12-2017,110785095,Titia,Dino is een geweldige gastheer. Hij weet leuke bezienswaardigheden van Londen en zal je veel tips kunnen geven! Respect voor elkaar en elkaars eigendommen staat bij hem hoog in het vaandel!

47192,228348075,19-01-2018,164712874,Alex,"Dino's place is outstandingly quiet, clean, and has great access to transport. Dino himself is very hospitable and gave me a suggestion about the Lumiere festival, which I might have missed if he hadn't mentioned it. I would definitely be willing to stay there again on a visit to London!"
47192,229415931,23-01-2018,24501683,Jimmy,I am a frequent user for f AirBnb and this was not the best experience in terms of communication. The house is clean but extremely cold. A lot of details and restrictive requirements that are almost like curfews. The interaction wasn’t pleasant but I don’t want to go in depth in public. The house is difficult to get to. The host almost not had a key for me to use. Get annoyed and became super passive aggressive with the slightest noise but the communication wasn’t straightforward. I expect very passive aggressive comments from the host but I sincerely hope things get better in the future.
47192,245244189,21-03-2018,21947577,Takeharu,"The location is the best, the room is also very beautiful. It was very reasonable and comfortable for three weeks."
47192,247616681,29-03-2018,44511379,Mark,"Very comfortable stay, nice and quiet which was great as I had work to do in the evenings, very kind and helpful host."
47192,250861651,06-04-2018,6886056,Farrah,"Dino was very nice and interesting to speak to. His place is perfect in terms of centrality, the views, good end of the day conversation, and a comfortable place to sleep if you're out all day. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you're looking for a very giant place or if you can't follow the house rules. I didn't find them hard to follow, but some might i.e. if you don't think about keeping the sink clean or if you're inclined to bring people back to your stay. Overall, it was a very good place to stay and I would recommend it. <br/>P.s. He contacted me afterwards to let me know I had forgotten clothes at his place during my stay & brought them to Euston Station. In essence, he is a great  and kind host."
47192,254290289,16-04-2018,133006656,Omar,"If you’re coming to London, Dino’s place is where to go. It’s not just the location that makes this place great, but more importantly, it’s Dino! He will bend over backwards to help you. He helped me by staying a bit late to going to work so I can drop of my luggage. He also knows the city very well, and his suggestions to places to see never failed me. <br/>Your comfort is paramount to Dino. The room is super clean, the bathroom is as clean, and the whole home has a welcoming atmosphere. I never scrunched my face at any dirtiness, as it never existed. <br/>Overall, if you’re coming to London and are looking for a great location, and an even better host, Dino’s place is where to go."
47192,256034655,22-04-2018,129940997,Kwee Fong,"Dino is a great host! On my arrival day, he constantly checked my location & gave continuous guidance on reaching his place. Eventually he met me at the street and walked me to his place. Immediately, Dino showed me around & explained amenities in detail.<br/>Every day, Dino chats with me on my plan for the day, and provides useful tips. E.g. places to go, fastest way to get there, tips to save $, and even the weather! Dino also provided maps, guides & travel books!<br/>He is great with directions and that has really helped tremendously, saving me precious time from figuring directions. When he heard I was going to musicals, he provided binoculars so I didn't have to rent at the theatre. <br/>Dino always made time to chat, and that to me was the unique & lovely experience of staying with an Airbnb host - it's not just a place to stay, but getting to know and hear from a local. He is thoughtful and has a good heart, interesting conversations if you take the time to chat with him.<br/>The room size was perfect for me, I didn't find it too small. Loved the design & view (the rest of the unit is awesome too). Though I mostly spent time outside, I always looked forward to coming back here.  Some days I wished I could just stay home & enjoy the room. The place is very clean.<br/>The location is good - close to 3 tube stations (10-15 mins walk) & some bus stops. <br/>I also appreciated that Dino was very accommodative of my traveling time and allowed me to drop off & deposit my luggage outside the check-in/check-out timing. He helped me carry my luggage when I arrived/was leaving. Such a gentleman!"

The flat is just next to Regent's Park, has a great view towards the park and the city itself, so the location is perfect; tube station and lots of bus services are just  5 minutes walking distance from the flat.<br/>Communication with the host has been easy and precise since the reservation request. Dino is happy to have a chat if you'd like to, and is very helpful; he knows a lot of the city and can help with many informations about what to see and even how to reach almost everything, from tourist attractions to parks, markets, etc.<br/>Just remember you're a guest in a private house: show respect for the place and the host.<br/>So, a nice room, clean and very well located, at a reasonable price, with a great host; I'd recommend it to everyone planning to visit London!"

He'd expect you to do the same.<br/>Most of the time, he keeps to himself and gives you your privacy, but is available for a recommendation or some advice if needed. <br/>Would definitely recommend people to in this beautiful apartment near Regent's Park, with Dino as your host."

He tried his best to give me some suggestions and gave  me convenience about checking in&out. I highly appreciate him. The room is clean, the location is good. It takes around 10 mins to get to tube station. There is also some bus station nearby his room, that’s nice!There are groceries downstairs. The view from the room is very beautiful, just as it looks in the pics he posted here.

47192,483213214,07-07-2019,193292,Jane,"Dino’s home is sparkling clean and very well-kept yet homey, with artistic touches everywhere that make it a cozy and welcoming place to stay.  The room (and also bathroom) is rather cramped with little space to manoeuvre and some might find it claustrophobic - but it was perfectly fine for me.  The view of Regents Park and rooftops of surrounding buildings from the trestle bed was a treat.  Another huge plus is The Central location of the place - it’s hard to beat and I’d happily stay there again.  Dino himself is an accommodating and welcoming host, and I greatly enjoyed my chats with him about his background etc"
47192,488723804,15-07-2019,114875840,Alexander,Great host!<br/>Very thorough and clean!

47192,526046834,08-09-2019,125715114,Martin,"It's an excellent place to be. The location is perfect, near from Euston train station, bus stops and if you like to walk you can reach the tourist center in less than 30 minutes. Everything is impeccably cleaned and organized. Although the room is small is very comfy and the view is amazing, you can wake up with an excellent view to the park. Dino is an excellent host and share with you his food and explains you every detail for having a great experience in London. He provided me a lot of flyers, museum maps and also a Oyster card for using the public transport."
47192,530065971,15-09-2019,204544919,Ferran,"This penthouse is a kind of magic place: it might be the best location in central London where you can see the sunrise and the sunset, as the views are amazing!

47192,537884763,29-09-2019,89306010,Jan,"This will not be a helpful review. Why? - Well, everything about this AirBnB is just perfect.<br/>Not helpful at all, right? - See, I told you so.<br/>But let me try a little harder:<br/>Let'S Dance is the kindest and most helpful host you could imagine: what to do, where to go, how to get there? - He will gracefully counsel you on everything and look up further information should need be.<br/>The room is small - no: snug! - with a very comfortable bed.<br/>The tastefully self-decorated home has enchanting details and is unnaturally clean. (I wish Let'S Dance came round my own place to work his magic.) Furthermore, it is pleasantly-located in a quiet area, allowing for comfortable walks through Camden, Regent's Park but even southwards to the Soho/Piccadilly area. And that is not taking into account that public transportation - both buses and the tube - are just around the corner.<br/>Really, I could go on but I probably ought to get back to work, so take this away: everything is just perfect."
47192,559522538,04-11-2019,9873422,Jean-Michel,"My second stay at Dino's place, same than the previous one : Dino is very nice, the room is clean, offer nice view and great location (5 min walk to Regent's Park, 5 min to Warren Street or Great Portland Street stations and that is very very nice depending on where you want to go). Area is nice and quiet and very few stations from downtown. Need something ? Just ask Dino, he will answer it with good will. Want to talk ? Dino can listen and has opinions to share. Want to stay in your room or quiet ? Dino won't disturb you. I enjoyed (once again) and i recommend."

He is extremely respectful of your privacy, yet he is always available to talk or if you need anything at all. He would always make sure the apartment was super clean and that fresh coffee would be available every morning, along with snacks. One of the things I enjoyed the most about London, where my conversations with Dino and I´ll be forever thankful that he would kindly share some of his artwork with me to take back home as a gift to my son. <br/>About the apartment, it is simply perfect. Location, cleanliness, style, view…I could go on forever. If I go back to London, I wouldn´t stay anywhere else. <br/>He was very very kind to allow me to leave my luggage early when I arrived, and then kept it for me even after check-out, so I could enjoy my last day in London. <br/>Thank you Dino!! You have a new friend in Argentina!"

47192,6.43334E+17,06-06-2022,451752828,Rafael,"When I arrived at the location I was immediately greeted by the Host Dino. Dino was really nice and gave kind of a tour with all the information of the appartement and the room I’m sleeping in. In my opinion you have just enough privacy to be on your own and chill out in the kitchen or room which is great. <br/>I came for a seminar of some people I really like so I didn’t really came to see a lot of sights or shop at a particular street in the city of London but I still was walking distance from a lovely park and the underground and rentable bikes are pretty much everywhere so getting around to see everything wouldn’t be a problem if you’re concerned about the location of the stay. In short, I don’t have anything negative to say and when I need to be anywhere close to Central London again I’m probably sleeping at the same place!"
47192,6.48375E+17,13-06-2022,435896768,Rodrigo,"Dino é um host incrível. Fiquei super à vontade em seu aconchegante apartamento. Localização excelente. Conversamos bastante sobre Londres, Reino Unido, viagens e outros assuntos. Numa determinada noite pudemos tomar algumas cervejas em um bar às margens do Tâmisa e em frente à London Eye. Recomendo altamente!"

I immediately felt at home, and loved the room - it felt like a lovely and safe cocoon to stay in. The view was so nice that I had a hard time leaving to explore the city. Dino made sure I had everything I needed, and I enjoyed the good public transport connections. I love taking the bus and they stopped right around the corner. If I wanted to get somewhere a bit faster the tube is really closeby too. So a perfect location and a wonderful home to stay in."

47192,6.78777E+17,25-07-2022,57278358,Manuel,"Sometimes there are hosts which can be a highlighted. That is absolutely something I can say about Dino and his flat. A lovely room with its wonderful ""Out of the bed view"" over London and its nice parks. Everything was perfectly at ease. Dino is a very friendly guy, providing you with all needed information. We had great talks, especially about the architecture of London. Dino would be a wonderful and very informative guide for visiting London and all things related to the life in UK. Highly recommended. Hope I have the possibility to come once again. Just great! Thankyou."

There is study place and enough plug. 2) Dino is super caring and helped with directions. 3) the bed is super comfortable and the air flow of the room is sufficient. Very clean and hearty. There was enough privacy, and is trans/queer friendly. 4) Dino is very creative, calm, and principled person to have a nice chat with. To know about the city, you have to get through someone who lived there. 5) It was very safe neighbourhood. 6) Thanks for the waffles, apple juice and tea. 7) Dino’s Art Deco and re-design of the small flat is worth appreciating. I would definitely recommend, revisit, and stay as friend. ;))"

47192,6.99162E+17,22-08-2022,472389813,Ignacio,"It was my first time spending vacation time alone, and Dino made it such an amazing experience!<br/>The description of his place is as accurate as it can be, and the place is really nice to spend a few days in London. Everything is at reach and the location is really convenient for us tourists!<br/>He really makes you feel comfortable and offers conversation and helpful advice to enjoy London at it’s fullest. The room was comfortable and it was very clean and private, same with the bathroom and kitchen areas.<br/>Also, it’s a LGBTQIA+ friendly and safe place to be at, so, another advantage!<br/>If I return to London and Dino’s place is available, it will definitely be my top priority choice!<br/>Thanks for everything Dino! 🦕<br/>Nacho."

The view from the room was gorgeous.The location is great near to bus station and a few minutes to a main train station.  A few stops to the central area i prefer to walk so it’s not that far from the flat. Finally The host, Dino is a great guy and he is so kind even though i came late due to the delay of bus ride. He waited for me till i reached the flat. You can ask him anything about the city he knows everything about London. BTW thanks to him i found a great spots to visit even trip advisor doesn’t tell you about it. I definitely will stat at his flat if visited London alone.<br/>Ciao"
47192,7.1436E+17,12-09-2022,256295278,Riley,"Dino was such a wonderful host! The apartment is beautifully designed, conveniently located, and very clean. Dino took the time to show me on the map where I needed to go and offer great recommendations. He was very accommodating and patient when my details got a bit mixed up and I had to check in later. Plus, he made me coffee in the morning! <br/>Overall, this is a great place to stay if you're crashing in London for a few nights. If you have a lot of belongings or you're looking for a more loungey type of experience, this may not be the place - the apartment is small and efficient. However, if you're just looking to pop in and out (like I was) it is excellent."

Das Zimmer ist ordentlich und aufgeräumt, allerdings wirklich sehr klein. Zum Arbeiten halte ich es für eher ungeeignet, es wäre aber durch den kleinen Tisch an der Seite möglich. Vom Bett hat man einen super Ausblick, und ich habe wirklich sehr gut geschlafen. Dino ist ein toller Gesprächspartner und hat viele interessante Dinge zu erzählen. Alles in allem kann ich den Aufenthalt wirklich sehr empfehlen!"

47687,119758,15-10-2010,254031,Lisa,I was pleasantly surprised that the description of the flat was true to reality. Very clean and very friendly hosts that were available when needed. A great concept and I would most definitely come back.

The tube station was only a short walk away, and there were a lot of supermarkets, pubs, and other conveniences in the vicinity. I would recommend this to everyone!"
47687,170590,15-01-2011,224979,Matthew,"The previous year, I had fallen in love with London and decided that for Holiday 2010 I would stay for a month to really get to experience living in the city. I knew that I wanted to a studio flat that was: close to the tube, had a small kitchenette, Wifi, satellite, and above all fit my budget. I have to say that Boris delivered this and then some. My experience is about as good as it can get. The photos don’t do the studios justice. I had a small single with new hardwood floors, a nice clean bathroom, a kitchen with everything you need to prepare a quick breakfast/meal, and a full size bed. The flats are in a beautiful town home style residence with the owners living on the first floor. Boris and his family are the most gracious hosts I have encountered. If I ever needed anything, Boris or his lovely wife were the first to attend to it. I was having too much fun to be bothered to do my laundry (laundry facilities onsite), so I would give it to them for the housekeeper and all my clothes would be waiting for me, perfectly folded on my bed. The location is amazing. You are about a 3 minute walk to the Hammersmith and Broadway tube (the District and Jubilee lines  - they take you anywhere you need to go) which is inside a little mall. There is coffee, a cinema, grocery store, cafes all within this complex as well as just outside your front door. If you enjoy the nightlife, the busses run constantly 24/7 from Soho/Picadilly Circus straight into Hammersmith every few minutes. I can’t say what a wonderful experience it was and am already looking forward to another stay next year! Just writing this is making me nostalgic and I’ve only been home a week!"
47687,173281,22-01-2011,1092,Bernard,"Price was right, Location was great. Host was wonderful. Bed was comfortable. All was right with the world. We would -- and have -- booked with Boris again. "
47687,174604,25-01-2011,241021,Teresa,"This is possibly the best value you can get for apartment-style lodging in London.  Full kitchen (appreciated the hot water kettle), great location with close proximity to Metro and easy access to downtown and Heathrow, nearby to grocery stores, etc.  Host was very nice.  My girlfriend and I had a lovely time.<br/><br/>My only complaints were that the shower temperature was finnicky and could intermittently switch from being warm to cold without us moving it in the slightest.  Also, the wifi was very spotty at times.<br/><br/>But still, nothing major and it was a great value."
47687,175795,29-01-2011,78885,Christopher,Very lovely studio and lovely host....great location as it is 5 minutes walk to Hammersmith Tube Station and two great Bistro Pubs nearby.
47687,177499,02-02-2011,293304,Zane,"We enjoyed our stay at Boris apartment. The apartment was nice, cozy and clean. Boris and his wife took good care of everything and were ready to assist and help whenever necessary. Recommend to everyone. "
47687,181713,14-02-2011,197198,George,"we stayed in London the 1st week of february, Hammersmith (glenthorne rd.)  it is a very nice and quite place to stay with tube & bus station nearby so in 15min you are downtown.<br/>The aviva studios were small but with all you'll need for a comfortable staying and also very clean and very warm, at very good price/night<br/>For sure if i ever have the change to visit London again i will look for aviva 1st.<br/>Place A+++++<br/>value/money A++++"
47687,183325,16-02-2011,205089,Steven,"Rooms great, very clean and well appointed, kind of like staying in a travel inn, THANKS for leaving tea and coffee and milk ! really makes a difference on arrival.<br/><br/>The location great for hammersmith tube , boris and his wife very very helpful and accommodating. Fantastic if your in london / hammersmith for work."
47687,185333,21-02-2011,104013,Tibor,"Fantastic location, kindest hosts ever, clean, and hospitable. Highly recommended!"
47687,204438,21-03-2011,338897,Jennifer,Boris and his wife were very nice. The location of the apartment was good. There is a Tube station with four Tube lines and a full bus station very close by. I would totally stay here again and recommend the apartment to others.
47687,218856,06-04-2011,340727,William,"Good location, great price, clean and tidy room. For access to central London, there is no beating Boris' flat in terms of value. The tube station is very close by and the surrounding area is really safe and clean. Boris is good at answering emails, and both he and is wife are very friendly and welcoming. We were overall happy with our stay, but the only unpleasant element was the cigarette smoke smell in the building. While the info on the room indicates it is non-smoking and there would be penalties for doing so, when you walk in the ground floor of the building, the cigarette smell hits you immediately and does waft up to the third floor where this flat is located. It didn't bother us too much at first, but on our last few nights there we got pretty tired of it, especially as it was warm and we opened the window for fresh air, but just got more cigarette smoke from the yard below. It was strong, but luckily not strong enough to stick with our clothes. If you're used to the smoke, you'll be absolutely fine, just as we pretty much were, but we thought it was worth mentioning as it can be an issue for some with allergies, asthma, etc. It wasn't bad enough to dissuade us from staying there again, and again, Boris and his wife are welcoming and accommodating hosts."
47687,232635,20-04-2011,257028,Pandora,"We really enjoyed our stay. The room was just as described and it was great having our own little kitchen so we could eat in after our long trip to London. Really safe area, lovely and quiet at night, but only a quick tube from all the action London has to offer. Great location and really friendly hosts. Would highly recommend. "
47687,259237,11-05-2011,101615,Danny,"Aviva Studio was a very good place to stay in London.  It was conveniently located just a couple minutes walk from Hammersmith station, which connects to 3 of the underground lines, making it easy to get anywhere in London.  Also it is on the Picadilly line from Heathrow Airport, which makes it very easy if you are arriving there.  Boris and his Wife were great hosts and the apartment was clean and well maintained.  <br/>There was slight mix up when we arrived and our room wasn't ready yet.  Boris set us up in the small Hotel directly next door for our first night.  It could have been a bigger inconvience then it was but Boris handled the situation quite well.  This place is a great value and I would stay here again."
47687,268968,18-05-2011,299453,Karla,"Everything wa great, Boris and his wife were very helpfull and the studio were we stayed was very clean big enough for us 2 and very good located (just 5 min walk to undegrund or bus station) and near the place also on the way to undergriund (5 min.) were a lot of stores markts shops etc."
47687,287182,30-05-2011,305679,Boon,"The location at Hammersmith is excellent, being less than 5 minutes walk to the Underground. The Underground is location in a shopping mall, where there is also a Tesco, McDonalds, Starbucks, and other various food options.<br/><br/>The studio itself is clean and well equipped, not small or cramped at all, and neither was the bathroom. We stayed there for 8 nights and had everything we needed for the 8 nights stay. "
47687,299283,06-06-2011,242706,Sabine,Boris' apartment is nicely furnished and centrally located. Boris has been very helpful and has always quickly responded to our requests. We’ll come back!
47687,310669,13-06-2011,295070,Lorel,"Great location - just 5 mins walk from the Hammersmith Underground<br/>Exactly as described<br/>Very clean<br/>Small spaces but well equipped<br/>Comfortable bed and we loved being able to open the windows<br/><br/>Friendly and helpful but not at all intrusive<br/>Thank you<br/>"
47687,359780,08-07-2011,319343,Héctor,"This studio is in a good location, near Hammersmith tube stations (a 5 minutes walk). The neighbourhood feels quiet and safe, even in the nights. It is very comfortable although is a small place, but you know that when you book the studio. Everything is as advertised and Boris is an excellent host. We'll be back for sure. "
47687,370133,13-07-2011,456215,Felicity,"This Studio is a great size for two people and offers all the amenities you'd need for a short to medium term stay in London.  It's very well located to Hammersmith's tube stations and local High streets.<br/>For anyone not wanting to pay for the Washing Machines that are supplied by Boris, there is a Laundromat on Fulham Palace Road, just 10 mins walk away - very close and cheap.<br/>You have all the shops you might want close by if you don't want to venture too far - M&S, Pret a Manger, Tesco and of course a handful of good gastro pubs!  The studio that we had good light and is well cooled with fan in the summer time, has a microwave and oven and two cook top elements.  The shower was small but is made up by having great water pressure for a nice hot shower, always hard to get on travels. In short, Boris runs a clean and efficient business and his Studio's would be a pleasure for anyone to stay at."
47687,379490,18-07-2011,190620,Paula,"The studio is in a great location, it is also very comfortable and has everything you need with a great cost-benefit. Boris is very gentle and helpful. Would certainly  pick Aviva Studios for a next stay in London."
47687,445316,15-08-2011,170410,Jayne,"This apartment was a good size for two people, with a firm, comfortable bed. The bathroom was modern and sparkling clean, with plenty of hot water for the shower. Kitchenette area had all we needed, including quality appliances (Bosch, I think) and makings for coffee and tea. <br/><br/>We were on the very top floor, with a pleasant rooftop/garden and distant skyline views. I should mention that this meant climbing 50 steps, so you had better be fairly fit for this particular apartment! I believe there are others as well. <br/><br/>Reception was on duty all the time and very obliging, carrying my bag up the stairs when we arrived, for example. WiFi worked great, too. <br/><br/>It was very close to the Hammersmith tube and bus stations, and we felt safe walking to neighborhood eating places nearby. We enjoyed  dinner at the Mason's Arms, a very short walk down the street.<br/><br/>We would stay here again and certainly recommend."
47687,535377,16-09-2011,328612,Mark,"Boris was a great host! The apartment that we were supposed to rent from him was having a few problems before we arrived so Boris offered us one of his bigger apartments in Shepard's Bush for no extra charge at all...this place was more than twice the size of the place I orginally booked!<br/>The location was great and it was very easy to get around London with the apartment being very close to two train stations.<br/>I highly recommend Boris as a host. He was friendly and very helpful."
47687,2832257,07-11-2012,2027219,Tyler,Terrific flat for a great price. Super close to Hammersmith Tube station. I'd certainly stay again.

47687,11076432,19-03-2014,12027945,Clément,"Super logement pour visiter Londres! Suffisamment vaste pour y être à l'aise à deux, même pour un séjour de plusieurs jours, très bien équipé (coin cuisine avec évier, plaques électriques, frigo, grille pain...), une salle de douche parfaitement propre.<br/>Les prestations sont du niveau d'un hôtel (passage d'une femme de chambre chaque jour, pour le ménage et la vaisselle, retaper le lit, changer les serviettes sales...).<br/>Le logement est situé à proximité de la station de métro Hammersmith, à 5 minutes à pied, avec des lignes directes pour le centre ville de Londres, ainsi que de nombreux bus.<br/>Boris est très disponible et réactif par mail pour répondre à toutes vos questions concernant votre séjour.<br/>Parfait!"
47687,13206390,22-05-2014,11318673,Yan-Wen,Both Boris and his wife are very friendly and helpful. Boris helped us with our luggages (which was very important for us). The unit was more spacious than we expected. Very clean and cozy. Very convenient location with accessibility to the bare necessities. Will definitely recommend to family and friends to stay next time. 
47687,14392133,18-06-2014,4081372,Sarah,Beautiful studio apartment... Clean and easy to find! Close to public transport and an easy ride via train to London City.

47687,15206973,05-07-2014,9930400,Katelyn,Exceeded expectations! Great location--especially if you are coming in from Heathrow and for the tube to anywhere in London. Very comfortable bed. Almost anything you need is already in the room. Entire staff was very helpful and everything went smoothly. Would definitely stay again!
47687,15642886,13-07-2014,16062695,Javier,Everything was very good. Great ubication to move around London. Studio has all we needed for a pleasenture stay. Boris and wife were very nice and colaborative.
47687,16713739,01-08-2014,14779757,Ingrid,It was a realy nice apartment in Hammersmith near bei the underground an the airport Hethrow. We stored our luggage for two times and everything was perfect. And everyone war very kindly. We enjoyed our stay there very much. Thanks for all.

47687,21444755,17-10-2014,20432684,Charlotte,"Great welcome, very easy to check in. The location is great and the property is amazing value - really clean and has everything you need. I have stayed a few times and would always go back if looking for a great place in London. "
47687,23888012,14-12-2014,10536578,Edith,Nice place! great value for money and near the hammersmith tube station. I stayed a weekend with my sister and I really liked it. Very clean and convenient. A good choice if you're going to see a show in the Apollo (very close). I'd be back. 
47687,28108211,17-03-2015,25986970,Rania,"I was welcomed by Boris' wife. She was welcoming and promptly showed me to my room to get a rest. The place was perfectly clean with all facilities as described. Place was compact as a hotel room, and had all needed for short stay. Building is cute and clean. Very good location with easy access to transportation. Both Boris and his wife were nice. "
47687,30504990,23-04-2015,17733913,Emily,"Everything as described, Boris was a great, easy communicator. Room was very small but clean and modern. Great location with lots of good connections to London via public transport. Thanks Boris. "
47687,32161153,15-05-2015,24609123,Rachel,Excellent location and great appartement. It had everything we needed. Boris and his wife were very welcoming and helpful. The check in process was smooth and had no issue at all while staying there... We will definitely recommend families and friends to stay there. 
47687,35239342,16-06-2015,28640718,Heidi,"Staying here was convenient to get to and it was very nice. Good communication over the phone as we didn't get in until 11pm and they were OK with it. The wifi was flaky which made it hard to plan our next day of travel. The cable tv stopped working after going through the channels once. Both of these may have been remedied had we wanted to bother them, but since it was so late we let it go. Personally, since we used it so little, I wish I had gotten a less expensive place with more reliable internet. C'est la vie!"
47687,39429608,23-07-2015,35816656,Jesse,"The studio was beautiful! Great utilities, location and privacy! I think the seal on the oven was broken but that didn't bother us too much as we weren't making any full meals, just heating up! Overall amazing place to stay, will definitely be staying here again next time I'm in London! "
47687,44892264,30-08-2015,11876535,Mehmed Said,"Good location, close to underground station. Sweet, very clean and useful home. Friendly hosting. The home meet all our needs. Good choice, thanks."

47687,49478713,04-10-2015,14426691,Kruno,"Amazing, is the only way I can describe our stay! We stayed in this studio for three days. The flat was located in a very convenience safe area, 100m away from the subway, next door to shops and restaurants. Boris and his wife was also an amazing host, they conveniently had everything available,  I hope to return next year :)<br/>All recommendations."
47687,50912671,16-10-2015,27653741,Mika,"Great place in a nice, quiet neighbourhood. The Hammersmith tube station is close by, and there are plenty of shops and restaurants just a few minutes' walk away.<br/><br/>Our room was nice and cozy, and the host was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again."
47687,52675978,01-11-2015,36517069,Carol,We had a very pleasant stay in Boris' studio flat in Hammersmith. The room was beautifully warm and the bed exceedingly comfortable.  As we were going to the Apollo theatre for a show the studio was perfectly placed - 5 min walk. Also great for getting the tube to central London the next morning. We would certainly use Boris' studio again if we were looking for accommodation in London.  
47687,74525253,15-05-2016,62794328,Philip,"We were really impressed by Boris' service - before we arrived at the property Boris messaged us to let us know that there was a temporary problem with the room but that he had therefore arranged alternative accommodation at a nearby hotel,which was comfortable, convenient and arranged with no hassle. Therefore, while we can't review the actual listed view, we can say that Boris went to great lengths to ensure we had a good stay."
47687,76678988,28-05-2016,42866147,Barbara,Boris was very accommodating. The room was clean and tidy. His wife was delightful. Great location just outside London proper. Parking can be a challenge. 
47687,77651207,02-06-2016,8079452,Andrew,"We were really happy with the room & service provided. Very good location and close to the tube station. The room was lovely, clean and well equipped."
47687,78186809,05-06-2016,53607378,Tobias,We are very happy with the accommodation. Nice and helpful attitude. The pictures and instructions match very well with the description. Thanks for a very nice weekend.
47687,81519005,23-06-2016,11059171,Owen,"Excellent stay, the studio was absolutely spotless. We were at the top of the building but Boris helped with our cases. Within an easy 5 minute walk of the underground station for our trip to Heathrow the following day. Great pub at the end of the road.<br/>Thoroughly recommend.<br/>"
47687,84330550,06-07-2016,2227409,Paul,"Great apartment, in a brilliant location - on a really nice, quiet street a short walk from Hammersmith Tube stations. The apartment was extremely clean and tidy and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, including air conditioning, a microwave, small hob, and a fridge. It's a vibrant and diverse area and nearby there are lots of great places to eat as well as numerous fast food outlets and takeaways.<br/><br/>We received a warm welcome at reception and, overall we couldn't fault the experience for location, comfort and value and would definitely stay here again next time we are in London."
47687,88194582,23-07-2016,61702025,Natalie,"This was a gorgeous place to stay, so close to the tube and easy walk to food and shopping. Hosts were lovely and always there to help. Would definitely stay again"
47687,88902250,25-07-2016,9697043,Ola,"We were staying in London only for one night and Boris's place worked out great. It was easy to find, when we arrived, a family member was there to greet us and give us a key to our room. The place is cozy but totally fine for a couple. It has a good size shower (note: you have to give it 2-3 minutes for the warm water to come out, at first I was worried I was going to have to have a cold shower lol). A big bonus, since London was a bit muggy on the day of our arrival, the room has an AC unit, which helped a lot to get some sleep.  Everything was clean, we were provided a towel each too! The neighbourhood is lovely as well. Kings street, which is a few streets down has a few markets and many pubs, places to eat. The place is close to a metro station so it was easy to go to centre the next morning as well.  Overall would definitely stay there again. "
47687,100765246,10-09-2016,62117155,Heather,"Had a great stay in Hammersmith! The room was clean and the location was very convenient.

47687,102816273,19-09-2016,24276800,David,Arrival was easy and host very helpful during the stay. Location was great for what I was doing. Very close to major bus and tube routes. 
47687,105333813,01-10-2016,41196458,Estelle,"Boris' room is actually a room in a small hotel, so the check in time is flexible. The stuff inside the room are brand new and keep very clean. It is at a good location which near to 3 underground lines. That was a very good stay."
47687,107382446,10-10-2016,40017747,Carlos,"La ubicacion es muy buena muy cerca del metro y buenas conexion con otras lineas y zonas para comer y comprar. Lo malo una pobre comunicacion  con boris, el mismo dia de mi reserva se comunico horas antes del check in despues de haber enviado mensajes, correos y llamadas sin poder tener una respuesta. Al final todo salió bien, La cama  no es de las mejores."

47687,5.96172E+17,02-04-2022,178368264,Yuki,Brilliant location would have loved to find it sooner on my trip so i could have rented longer. 2 Floors up was the only flaw.

47687,6.07769E+17,18-04-2022,439734790,Holly,"The apartment was fantastic for our weekend break, conveniently located just a short walk from a major tube station & with good local shops etc. Would definitely recommend for short, romantic breaks as the space is quite small."
47687,6.50603E+17,16-06-2022,401098358,René,"Our stay at Boris’s apartment was really great. The room is small but the size is totally adequate for 2 persons for a few days. Disregarding the window which didn’t open all the way up and the missing extractor hood the Airbnb was well equipped. <br/>Moreover, the location is amazing for a short trip to London due to the tube station which is only 3 minutes walking distance away providing a 20 minutes tube ride into the city centre. In consideration of the fact that almost all other apartments in London charge a higher price, this Airbnb stands out as the perfect cost-efficient alternative."
47687,6.52762E+17,19-06-2022,49410640,Armando,"Apartamento localizado muito próximo a um metrô com várias linhas, então você fica a uma viagem direta a qualquer lugar da cidade. Apartamento aconchegante. Possui dois lances de escada até chegar lá."

Otherwise a pleasant stay. I would definitely recommend."

Bem perto da estação de Hammersmith, onde conseguimos fazer todos nossos deslocamentos com praticidade e segurança. Comércio, bares e restaurantes ao redor.

The mattress is not comfortable at all and the pillows are uncomfortable. It would've been nice to have a rug on either side of the bed too.<br/>It was quite difficult to carry  heavy suitcases up all the stairs too.<br/>The TV didn't work but Boris and his wife were very helpful and tried to resolve the problem but were not able to.<br/>However, the property was perfect for what we needed."

Se encuentra en una zona tranquila y a dos minutos andando de varias líneas de metro y una estación de autobuses, así que puedes ir prácticamente a cualquier lugar de la ciudad con facilidad. Tiene acceso de metro a la línea Hammersmith (rosa), Circle (amarilla), District line (verde) y Picadilly (azul) que te conecta con todos los sitios destacables de Londres. La ubicación es un 10.<br/>El alojamiento en sí también es estupendo en relación al precio y lo que ofrece. <br/>La cama es muy cómoda y todo estaba muy limpio.

Only room for improvement is that when booking for two, you should get two duvets and not have to share :-) we asked for another but there was no extra. No worries though, still a great place to stay in all aspects."

Most things are just a 10-15 minute tube ride away and the tube station is a 5 minute walk from the Airbnb. Not to mention very easy getting from Heathrow to Hammersmith. The area is quiet at night which made for a great nights sleep and there is an AC unit for £5 a day if you want AC at any point. There were tons of restaurants and cafes in the area, too. Communication was great and Boris’s wife is so kind and friendly. We would absolutely stay here again!"

We came in early and they allowed us to drop off our bags while we toured the city and the room was prepared. Super convenient location near two different underground stations. Small but clean, perfect place for us given we were only going to sleep there. Had a small kitchenette with utensils and universal plugs in it. Very thoughtful. Would absolutely stay again."

The bed was very comfy!<br/>They were very accommodating with our check-in after our late flight into London (They live on the lower floor of the establishment).<br/>Dusica even did our laundry for 20 pounds (folded and all), which made bringing less clothing an option (Thanks again for that)! You just have to use the labeled bags (in the closet) and let them know you need help with the laundry.<br/>I love the fact that their place is near the Hammersmith stations (like a 3 to 4 mins walk), which made getting around easy enough.<br/>I highly recommend their place to stay if you are visiting London. It honestly felt like a cozy hotel!  Again, thank you to the hosts. You both made our trip memorable and comfy!"
47687,1.00211E+18,14-10-2023,76351525,Kyler,"Location, value, and price! Friendly hosts and very good of communication. Easy access to the subway and bus stops, with many restaurants, pubs, and coffee shops nearby. It was also quiet for a busy city location. One thing to know is the stairway is steep and narrow, so if you have trouble with the stairs, you may want to think about this one. There is also an extra charge for air-conditioning, however, we didn’t need it. Would absolutely recommend and would stay here again!"

49970,202101,18-03-2011,378633,Brook,"The Aviva rooms are great, and I would recommend them for your stay in London. They are conveniently located in Zone 2 in a short walking distance to the Hammersmith tube station, and there are also several buses that stop right across the street. Also in a short walking distance from the house there is a shopping mall and shopping area as well as two traditional English pubs. It was very easy to take the Underground straight from Heathrow airport to the studio. Boris is very friendly and graciously greeted me, even when I arrived earlier than planned. The Aviva rooms are just like having your own hotel room, but without the hassle associated with low cost hotels. I originally planned to stay at a hotel in London but they were so expensive and the guest reviews were awful, so I turned to AirBNB, and I am glad I did. Aviva 7 is half the cost of comparable hotel rooms AND you get a kitchenette. If you are looking for a hotel room experience, this is the property for you. You have your own studio and can come and go as you please. I didn't see Boris during my stay, but I knew he was available on site should I ever need anything. I think you will have an enjoyable experience if you come with realistic expectations for the cost. Yes, the walls were thin, the bed was not particularly comfortable - but you would get these same conditions at a hotel room for TWICE the price. I would recommend, however, that if you like to read in bed, to bring a portable reading light as their is none in Aviva 7 (only light source is the window and overhead room light). Also if you like to sleep with two pillows, to bring a second with you (although you may be able to ask Boris for one as well). In conclusion, the Aviva studios are a bargain for their cost, and the location alone is worth it."
49970,204622,21-03-2011,374240,Dinah,It was a very great experience. Boris himself was as kind as a host could be! Very clean and cute appartment. I can really advise you to stay there!

49970,220057,07-04-2011,401183,Tim,Conveniently located. The tube is a 5 minute walk and plenty of restaurants in the area. Apartment was very clean and Boris was more than accommodating . I plan on recommending Boris to friends traveling through London. 
49970,224153,12-04-2011,378485,Amaia,"The studio was just as described! It has everything you are going to need during your stay, and the hosts are really friendly. <br/>The area is 20 minutes away from the center of London by underground, and the station is really close to the studio. There's also a shopping area nerby where you can get pretty much anything.<br/>We had a great experience and will definitely recommend it to friends. I'd come back without a doubt.<br/>Thank you!<br/>"
49970,229614,18-04-2011,356900,Stuart,"I stayed in Aviva 7. Boris does an amazing job keeping these units in a clean condition. On arrival, Boris was there to welcome me and explain anything I needed.<br/><br/>I can only comment on Aviva 7. Other units may be different. Be aware that this is basic accomodation. The rooms are small. This is not a fancy place by any means. But for a very reasonable price, you get a comfortable bed, kitchen appliances, a quiet room, and plenty a nearby shopping. London is about 30 minutes by tube. <br/><br/>I have stayed in places in London that were as small at mutiples of what I paid here.<br/><br/>IEven if you are not on a tight budget, this is a place to consider for a few days.<br/><br/>The 5 star rating is based on Boris's achivement of a room for a very reasonable rate. "
49970,246185,01-05-2011,378866,Casey,"Boris was a great host and the apartment and building were SO NICE. I would say the pictures don't do it justice. It felt more like a hotel (in a good way) than an apartment. The building was nice and updated, and the neighborhood was great. A very short walk to the Hammersmith ""tube"" station made it very convenient. We loved staying there and had a relaxing stay... even on the crowded Royal Wedding weekend. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks Boris!"
49970,248535,02-05-2011,516917,Anqi,"Though i didn't get to stay there due to personal reason but the process of booking and enquiry with Boris was fantastic. He replied very promptly and give good alternatives when the room i wanted was not available.<br/><br/>*please do not see my rating as it is not very accurate because i didn't  get to stay there. But i wanted to post a review  on my good experience with Boris.."
49970,274389,22-05-2011,375511,Larry,The apartment location was great as it was next to a train/bus terminal and was about half way between the airport and the heart of London. Boris met us on arrival and got us situated in the unit promptly. The apartment was just right for us and everything worked properly. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to others.

49970,350985,04-07-2011,348266,Laetitia,"We didn't stay in Aviva despite we booked 6 nights, because of broken pipes damaged the roof of the room we reserved, so officially it is not appropriate to leave the feedback.<br/>But I insist expressing our deep thanks to Boris and his wife here that, they were very helpful looking us a place to stay, very nice making sure everything was okay, while at the same time dealing with the all-in-a-sudden damage.<br/>From our couchsurfing experience(a night at their living room), we can at least tell you: the apartment is perfectly located with most things around, neighborhood is quiet and safe, and they are genuine people to trust."
49970,512631,08-09-2011,453934,Andreas,We really enjoyed our stay at Aviva Studio! It was clean and quit. Very close to the Hammersmith underground stop. Highly recommended if you are travelling on a budget.
49970,1061212,30-03-2012,1594113,Kate,"Excellent location, I stayed in a couple of different rooms.  first was room 9 which was a large 3 person room and second was room one which was a lovely room tucked away in the.  Its a clean, warm dry and safe place to stay and it located really well for the tube etc.<br/><br/>I found that noise travelled within the building and thats why i have marked it 4 stars rather than 5 - if i was able i would have marked 4.5 stars.  If i had stayed in the attic the whole time I would have scored it 5 stars as it was really peacful up there :)<br/><br/>I am usually in London for a few days do its great taht there is a hob and an oven as well as a microwave, little touches such as salt and pepper, a wine glass, a chopping board and a sharp knife in the room as well as a wee mint on my pillow all help to make your visit as comfortable as possible. I will definatley reccomend this venue to my colleagues"
49970,2775086,01-11-2012,327416,Kelly,"We were really impressed by the quality and professionalism of Boris and his room. He was great to communicate with, and the studio is lovely (the photos don't do it justice!). After traveling for a month, it was so nice to stay in such a clean and comfortable studio (it was our favorite place on our whole trip). The bed was awesome--my boyfriend loved the pillows, and the shower was the best of our trip (great water pressure, and plenty of hot water). The studio was really well located, very close to the tube, with access to several lines, so it made it very convenient to get around (also convenient to/from heathrow, which was a big plus for us). The street was nice and quiet, and we slept like babies! I would definitely stay here again, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone else looking for a place to stay. "

49970,14738766,25-06-2014,14927082,Sq,"I had a wonderful stay at the studio. Extremely value for the price I paid and what was provided exceeded my expectations. Room was small but what can I expect of a studio in the city of London... Everything was very clean and amenities nicely provided for which made the stay extremely cosy. Was touch tricky finding the place when I first arrived but it is really just less than 5mins walk from hammersmith tube station. There's tesco supermarket and other shops at the station itself, so really convenient. I would definitely stay here again when I go back to london! "
49970,16451379,28-07-2014,12870112,Catherine,"Boris was really nice and welcoming. The apartment was as described and pictured. It was perfect for our one night stay. The area was also really nice with lots of shops and restaurants and a really nice park a short walk away.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay again if in the area. "
49970,18075875,21-08-2014,8642007,Shane,"We loved staying here, great area and very close to the metro (took about 20-30 mins to reach Picadilly Circus). It felt safe and it was close to lots of shops. The studio apartment was very clean and fresh, we were so thankful for the room service each day."
49970,18980005,04-09-2014,9908298,Sam,"Fantastic Apartment.  Well situated - 5 mins walk from tube station, and 10 min walk from Arena - so ideal for staying here for events at the arena.  Quiet area, we were not bothered by any noise either internally or externally - although we were at rear of property.  We were greeted most warmly and shown to our room, which was for 3 people (only 2 of us) - and it seemed a decent enough size, extremely clean, and enough facilities/equipment to cook and eat a meal (although we only stayed for one night - so didn't bother).  Bathroom good size, nice and clean and good shower.  Bed very comfortable, and very clean.  Nice modern décor.  A very good stay and would come back and also recommend."
49970,19352602,10-09-2014,20432684,Charlotte,"This was a great place to stay, really close to the station and the local amenities.

49970,20600335,02-10-2014,17486933,Rommi,"A handy and very convenient location for going to see the Kate Bush concert at the Hammersmith Odeon. Overall, a well-kept suite which had everything I needed in it for one night. Might be a bit small for a longer stay, but then I also had three suitcases with me.. and another person might not. A comfy bed. Boris very helpful with carrying luggage upstairs as there is no lift. Good to have access to a small kitchenette to prepare food. "
49970,22796184,15-11-2014,16740317,Belén,"La semana pasada estuvimos tres dias en Londres para cumplir el sueño de ver un concierto en directo de Lykke Li, nuestra cantante favorita.  Elegimos los apartamentos Aviva por la cercania al teatro Eventim Apollo (apenas unos minutos andando) y realmente este alojamiento superó nuestras expectativas. <br/>La primera noche, nuestro apartamento no estaba listo todavía y nos pasaron a otro en el edificio de al lado.<br/> Simplemente increíble.  Un apartamento enorme, con dos cuartos de baño, amplio dormitorio y salón con zona de comedor y cocina incluida.  Todo limpio, confortable....no faltaba detalle, era lo más parecido a estar en casa.<br/>Las dos noches restantes estuvimos en otro apartamento un poco más pequeño pero igual de encantador.  Las camas cómodas, toallas limpias todos los dias, un pequeño kit de desayuno, ducha perfecta con agua caliente...  La calle es muy tranquila,  apenas escuchas ruido y a pocos minutos tienes toda la zona comercial.  Había una pequeña plaza con comidas de todas las partes del mundo,que nos encantó.<br/>En general el barrio, muy cosmopolita, alegre y tranquilo a la vez.  Tienes bares, tiendas y restaurantes a un paso.  También está muy cerca el metro y la estación de Hammersmith,  donde puedes coger trenes y buses a donde quieras. La gerencia del hospedaje extremadamente amable.  La chica que nos atendió un verdadero encanto.<br/>Sin duda, volveremos algún día a esta zona y nos volveremos a alojar aqui.<br/>Una experiencia única.  100% recomendable"
49970,23476415,01-12-2014,23932862,Andy,"Extremely welcoming and friendly host. Secure, quiet and comfortable room, well kept and exceptionally clean. 2 mins walk to the tube and shops so well placed. Great for a short stay over. "
49970,24543882,30-12-2014,16435725,Luca,"My gf and I spent Christmas in London, and had a lovely stay at the Aviva. The position is awesome, just minutes from Hammersmith station, which assures an easy and quick link with the main hot-spots in London. The studio is small but it is smartly furnished and equipped with everything is required for a short stay, including pots, plates and a hairdrayer. We found the room very tidy and clean, and a daily cleaning service was available during the whole stay. Boris was a kind and helpful host:  we were impressed by the number of positive reviews he has and, once we met him, we have to say that they are very well-deserved. Before the departure,  we contacted him  and  he answered within minutes, giving  promptly all the informations we  were looking for. In conclusion, if you are looking for a smart accomodation in London, the Aviva is definitely the right choice. Absolutely recommended."

Boris was there to welcome us and helped us with our bags. The room was very clean and had everything we needed. Bed was a tad on the uncomfortable side but still got a good nights sleep. 
49970,34871715,13-06-2015,3833151,Karissa,Boris was very responsive to e-mails prior to our arrival. His studio was lovely and very easy to find (about 2-3 minutes walk from the Hammersmith Underground station). Boris even kept our luggage for us as we explored the city the next day and we picked it up on our way to the airport. Loved his place and his service!
49970,36694590,30-06-2015,28587071,Matt,"Loved it - just as it looks. Cosy, with everything you need, and a lovely location that's a short tube journey to  all the sites. "

49970,84785079,09-07-2016,12762193,Jenny,"Sadly, there was an accidental double booking. But when I arrived they had arranged for me to stay at the B&B next door at no additional cost to me, which was lovely. Thanks for the quick fix! "
49970,87101365,18-07-2016,53758171,Melinda,"Although we did not have the pleasure of meeting Boris, his wife is an extraordinary woman,gracious in every way. She was helpful with Directions, current events,and any need we had which more than made up for the basic accommodations. It is brilliantly located to the underground,and great restaurants. We were happy to stay there."
49970,95765674,20-08-2016,8328024,Rosa,"Hemos estado 11 días en este apartamento. Es pequeño pero con todo lo necesario para poder preparar desayunos o una cena improvisada. Está todo muy limpio, cambian las toallas cada día y también limpian el apartamento. La cama es muy cómoda. Está en una zona que aunque no es el centro está perfectamente comunicada con cuatro líneas de metro, que te llevan a cualquier lugar en 15-20 minutos. El metro está a cuatro minutos andando del alojamiento, es una zona muy tranquila y en la calle de abajo hay restaurantes, supermercados, sitios de comida rápida y en el mismo metro un supermercado Tesco que abre hasta medianoche. Boris fue muy amable, contestó siempre rápidamente a mis preguntas y nos ayudó a subir y bajar las maletas, nosotros estabamos en un segundo piso. Recomendaría este apartamento y yo misma si vuelvo a Londres repetiría aquí mi estancia."

49970,115174208,22-11-2016,92586061,Sam,"Cozy, little apartment in the heart of Hammersmith with wonderful access to public transport, this was a good place to stay but I would highly recommend more than 1 night, as we didn't get to experience as much as we would have liked. Bathroom and apartment was a little small, but good use of space, I would stay again. "
49970,122274043,22-12-2016,21985585,Rafal,"Location was awesome. 30 min away from the center of London from Hammersmith. Lots of cafes, restaurants, banks, grocery stores nearby. I parked right in front of the place. After 18:30, parking is free until 8:30 in the morning the next day. Room was a bit smaller than I thought but it was the perfect size for a one day stay. The room had all the necessities, even a kitchen sink, fridge, and stove. Lovely place. Would stay again!"
49970,124262980,01-01-2017,44144529,Elodie,"Boris was available whenever we needed and welcomed us properly. The place is exactly in line with the photos we can see on website and has all the necessary equipment.<br/>The appartment is next to the underground (3 minutes walking) which is very convenient.<br/><br/>We recommend Boris' flat and we will come back for sure. Thank you Boris."
49970,142245720,07-04-2017,5142023,Alan,"This place was so convenient and perfect to stay in for a London trip. Would 100% recommend for both business and pleasure, it's close to everything you need in Hammersmith which also has great tube connections to everywhere in the city and also Heathrow airport. The rooms are clean and exactly as seen in the photos. We will be staying again!"
49970,147966887,29-04-2017,65071478,Ashley,Great little spot to crash in Hammersmith! We stayed here for a quick overnight to London and the location was great - close to public transportation and tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Room was comfortable and quiet; overall a great stay!

"
49970,163083976,23-06-2017,67566724,Vikki,"The studio was perfectly located near bars, restaurants, the Lyric theatre and the Apollo. However it was still really quiet, on a more residential road just minutes walk away from everything. The studio was perfectly clean, with the most comfortable pillows I have ever slept on! It has everything you need, with a hob and microwave as well as a fridge. It even had an air conditioning unit which was really welcomed as it was a super hot evening. Tea and coffee provided as well as linen and towels. The shower was pretty good, it took a while to get warm but then it was lovely, and very roomy which was unexpected for a small studio. The bed also was a big double and very comfortable. I highly recommend this studio and I will definitely stay again! "
49970,164625691,28-06-2017,13088778,Sam,"Just as described. Feels like a small hotel room with a minimal kitchen. Great for 1-2 people who don't plan on entertaining/spending too much time at the space (only due to room size). Very clean, in a nice neighborhood, and close to public transit."
49970,165475100,01-07-2017,14646881,Keri,"The host was wonderful. Everything about our stay was wonderful. The room was very clean and well organized. We had chocolates on our pillows when we arrived. Boris helped us bring the luggage upstairs and downstairs when we checked in and out. Our room was on the 3rd floor so that was very helpful after a long tiring flight. The owners of the building lives below so they are always available.  Boris recommended some great restaurants while we were there. The neighborhood is very safe and has plenty of great food and stores within 5-10 minute walking distance. The Hammersmith train station is about a 5 minute walk. All in all, it was a wonderful stay. "
49970,168879764,10-07-2017,131709167,Rosie,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Aviva studios for our last night in England. The location was very easy to find, especially from Hammersmith station. It was clearly marked with post on the building for 'Aviva'. We stayed in a small studio room with a little kitchen, which we did not use. However, it was stocked with plenty of kitchen utensils, which we used to eat our Indian Takeout. The most 'warm' welcome for us, was finally indulging in the joys of air conditioning, which was much needed after the sweltering weather (which we can't complain about, of course). The location was perfect for us because we were flying out from Heathrow, which was a half an hour train ride directly from Hammersmith. <br/>We ordered food from Indian Express, which delivered to the building...and if you love Indian food, I strongly recommend it! All of the grocery stores were closed because it was a Sunday night, so we walked about 5 minutes to a little shop, the Tipsy Toad, where we were greeted by a very nice woman. We got some beer (which is essential for Indian) and went on out merry way."
49970,171357124,17-07-2017,17896050,Hannah,"We stayed here one night as we flew in from stansted and out from heathrow the next morning. The location was great for catching public transit so we could get into the city, and also for getting to the airport the next morning. We also walked to a nearby restaurant and there were plenty of options. The room was clean, well-kept and just what we needed. If we come back to London, we would definitely stay here again."

Anche il quartiere in sé é piacevole e c'é tutto il necessario. Boris, signora che ci ha accolti e signora dei servizi molto cortesi, discreti e piacevoli. La stanza era piccolina ma okay per il prezzo e pulita in tutto, letto spazioso, bagno molto piccolo con lavandino inutile (abbiamo usato quello della cucina, peró) mentre la doccia era buona. La finestra della camera non stava aperta e il piumone sul letto scaldava eccessivamente, ma nel complesso é stato un soggiorno piacevole. Nota positiva, le prese universali, anche usb."

Apartment that we booked was very comfortable for two people. Off street parking was a convenience indeed. A great place in Hammersmith to live in ! Will be booking next time too when we visit."
49970,362400380,26-12-2018,227490241,Kostas,"Nice and clean room, very close to the Underground station of Hammersmith (Picadilly line-line that heads to Heathrow terminals). Boris respond quickly to our questions as we visited London at a very difficult day with no means of transport (25th of Dec)!!! We will definitely choose him for our next visit to London!"

49970,369331027,10-01-2019,169129135,Mel,"Check in was super easy and quick. The room was clean and modern, having all essentials in for a few nights stay, but could easily serve as a base for a longer term. Good access to central London via the tube and plenty of shops and restaurants in Hammersmith (on the doorstep!) too!"
49970,402385623,18-01-2019,3560443,Amy,"Sparkling clean, just a stone's throw from Hammersmith station. Comfortable bed, secure location, and check-in/out was a breeze. Would highly recommend and will definitely stay again in the future. Thank you, Boris!"

49970,408753098,05-02-2019,21868377,Meghan,"This apartment is very tiny as the description says, but it was perfect for our one night stay. We weren’t really sure about the location but it was actually fantastic! The apt is about a block from Hammersmith station so we took the tube there from the airport. We ate at a pub called The Swan (so good!) and had breakfast around the corner at a small Crepe place. Lots of places to eat/drink within a couple blocks."
49970,409602639,08-02-2019,75589244,Daniel,"I could definitely recommend this Studio for people who want to discover London. It is located in Hammersmith near the underground station, which is just a 5 minute walk from the Studio. Communication with Boris was super, he always answered after a few minutes. Check-In was also easy, because there is a small reception on the ground floor of the building. The studio itself was very clean, everything matched with the Airbnb description."
49970,412386509,15-02-2019,32337269,Susan,The studio is in a great location just a few minutes' walk from both the Hammersmith stations so there is lots of choice of tubes and buses.  We dealt mainly with Boris' wife who was lovely - really friendly and helpful. The studio is small but was fine for 5 nights although larger men may find the shower and wash basin a little on the small side.  It had everything we needed and was spotlessly clean and very tastefully decorated. The studio is in a house with several studios/apartments in it (which was not clear to me at the time of booking) so you do hear other guests moving around as in any hotel. This particular studio looks out on to Glenthorne Road which is a fairly busy one-way street and although the glazing in the windows is very good one does hear a bit of road noise and also the trains that run on the other side of the building site opposite where work starts relatively early. Although I am a very light sleeper it was OK with the windows closed and earplugs. Would definitely recommend and would definitely stay again.

Alles ist super organisiert und professionell abgelaufen, das Apartment ist bestens ausgestattet und sehr geschmackvoll gestaltet. Z.B. haben wir sogar Adapter für das englische Stromnetz erhalten. Es war super sauber. Die Lage ist fantastisch. Alles (U-Bahn, Bus, Supermärkte, Shops, Restaurants und Pubs) in nur wenigen Minuten fußläufig zu erreichen. Boris ist ein hilfsbereiter und angenehmer Gastgeber. Wir haben uns rundum sehr wohlgefühlt und würden es jederzeit wieder buchen. Nur zu empfehlen!"

They are also flexible with check-in and check-out time, which was extremely helpful. The place was very clean and had all of the necessities for a few night stay.<br/>The neighborhood outside the apartment had a lot of life within walking distances. However, it was very quiet when you were in the loft. The apartment was walking distance to some tourist attractions, and it was close to the bus station and tube station to get you to the ones further away. This is definitely the perfect place to stay in Hammersmith."

Very comfortable and a good location for the tube, the Hammersmith Apollo and the Lyric theatre. <br/>I have problems with my knees and hips and was on a higher floor, so if stairs are a problem ask for a lower floor when you book.<br/>I’m happy to recommend this and would stay again."

49970,4.87464E+17,03-11-2021,8290055,Laura,"great little place; very conveniently located in a nice area and central; easily accessible by various tube lines.<br/>Check in was very easy, Boris was super flexible and let me check in later than the normal check in times which was extremely appreciated.<br/>Place was as advertised; had everything you need - towels, hair dryer, dishes, microwave and hob, etc.<br/>it is quite small which is very normal for London and not a problem for a couple or close friends if you are in the city and just need a place to sleep.<br/>Good value for money"
49970,5.30216E+17,01-01-2022,175078128,Charlotte,"Absolutely lovely place, great value and location! Honestly I don’t have any qualms apart from the fact that when we typed in the location of the place it took us to a completely different area of london 😂 this is honestly our fault but just worth noting that when finding this place search “Aviva apartments” to find it in Google maps!"
49970,5.32483E+17,04-01-2022,435237353,Heather,"Decent location, very worth the money if you’re looking for somewhere easy to access most attractions and the city centre"

49970,5.81038E+17,12-03-2022,13233827,Ludmila,"If you are on a budget and are going to stay a short period in London, staying the majority of the time out, then go for it.<br/>The apartments facing the backyard are silent by night, but at 7h30 am the construction site begins all the noise that lasts until 16h30, during weekdays.<br/>Unfortunately, Boris wasn't in the country for the first 20 days of my 1 month's stay, and neither his cleaner nor his daughter were aware of the cleaning arrangements (once per week, but I only had the apartment cleaned twice, being the first time after almost two weeks) or the laundering machine use (I was told I could use it once per week and his daughter wanted to charge me 10£ for its use). When I arrived, I noticed the shower handle was broken, I let Boris know immediately and he told me someone would go to my apartment on the following day to fix it... but a man only showed up to install a new handler 8 days later, meanwhile I had to tie the handler with my watch so it would be kept in a position I could shower.<br/>Also, it is advertised that the apartment has condiments and spices (salt, pepper) so you can prepare your food, but there weren't any condiments, nor oil. I might thank Boris, though, for his daughter gave me 5 bags of tea on my first night.<br/>Plus, the cleaner is extremely rude. When I asked her (during the first week) what was the day of the cleaning because the apartment had a funny damp smell (every time someone uses the toilet on the upper floor,  it is possible to listen to a leak on the bathroom ceiling, that is filled with mold stains), and also how I could get new litter bags (I wasn't aware that they were kept inside the litter), she answered me that it wasn't her problem and she kept postponing the first cleaning. And she was cynical enough to tell me I should clean the apartment because it was smelly when she cleaned it (even though there wasn't any cleaning tool in the room except for the dish soap and a tiny sponge for the dishes... I didn't even have a kitchen cloth, which I had to buy at the supermarket).<br/>And to end it, on Friday, March 4th, I met the cleaner at the hall, she said: ""today inspection. understand? inspection"" (which consisted in her entering the room, looking at the bathroom and the room and not saying what she found). I told her I was going to have a shower and, after that, I would call her and she could come and inspect. What wasn't my surprise when 15 minutes later, I was showering and started to hear noises coming from the room... I got out of the shower naked to find her inside my room, with the door and the window completely open, starting to clean the sink. And I had to firmly insist that she should leave because I was naked and needed to, at least, put some clothes on... That was an unacceptable violation of my privacy and she didn't even apologise for that."

49970,5.86815E+17,20-03-2022,295426980,Katarzyna,"Really nice place to stay for a few days. Perfect location - Hammersmith as itself is a very nice district with walking spots, coffee houses and parks. 3 minutes from Hammersmith underground station which gives a hudge comfort when you want to visit many places in London. Despite the short distance to shops, undergrounds, bus stations etc. it’s a quiet place perfect for some rest. The only downside is the bathroom which needs some refresh. Anyway it’s a place to recommed with great price-quality ratio. See You next time! :)"

49970,8.77446E+17,25-04-2023,74730711,Andrew,The space is small but has everything you need to enjoy your stay. The location of the place is a bit further from the hammersmith tube station than I would have liked. The bed was not very comfortable and that could use improvement. Overall for the price it is good value. Hammersmith is a great area to stay in while you are visiting London.

Boris hat uns dennoch freundlich begrüßt und uns eher einchecken lassen. Das Zimmer war sauber, Bett bequem, WLAN hat auch stabiler funktioniert als Zuhause. Fußläufig innerhalb von maximal 5 min waren eine Shopping Mall, eine Einkaufsstraße mit allem was man braucht (Lidl, Drogerien, Apotheken, Bars, Cafés und Restaurants) auch Bus und Bahnstationen um ganz London gut zu erreichen. <br/>Gerne wieder"

Vom Flughafen ist es etwa eine halbe Stunde mit der U-Bahn entfernt. Auch die Innenstadt mit den Sehenswürdigkeiten ist nur 20 Minuten Fahrzeit mit der U-Bahn entfernt. Der Check-In und auch der Check-Out liefen sehr reibungslos ab. Das Zimmer selbst war zwar relativ klein, aber definitiv ausreichend. Die Sauberkeit war im großen und ganzen auch in Ordnung. Für mich auf jeden Fall nochmal ein Besuch wert…"

Secondly we were really pleased that Sarah had kindly bought some food for us - eggs, milk, blueberry, bananas, bread etc. It was very nice:)  Thank you, Sarah! Moreover she let us stay on our departure date till the time we left for the airport - this is a great advantage vs the hotel with its strictly demanded check-out hour. On the whole she did her best to make us feel at home (sent some useful links and gave the advises about restaurants and shops) and we definitely enjoyed our 12 days in Londay. <br/>The flat has everything one needs for the comfortable stay - it's not spacious but quite enough for 2 adults, tidy, clean and nicely decorated by Sarah herself. There are all the necessary kitchen utensils for cooking which I really liked.<br/>The area is quiet and pretty, close to the underground station and bus stops.<br/>Notting Hill is a wonderful district for shopping, dining out and afternoon walks.<br/>I will highly recommend to book this flat for a couple who is going to London for 1-2 weeks.<br/> "

The neighborhood was so pretty and a close walk to shopping, eating, entertainment.  You can walk to Portobello Market, which was one of my favorite days in London.  Sarah gave us wonderful recommendations for the area.  You can walk to everything you need, the Royal oak tube station is a two minute walk, also there are bus stops near by.  Hope one day to return!  "

The nice location, the wifi access and cleanliness were great. Highly recommended and we'll definitely stay there again next time."
51830,934122,20-02-2012,1696861,Kc,Great location and easy exchange.  She left us some food and coffee and allowed us to check in early.  Recommended some spots in the neighborhood to get groceries and have dinner.

51830,1069157,01-04-2012,1917498,Cinzia,"Io e il mio fidanzato abbiamo trascorso 4 giorni a Londra e la  vacanza e' stata perfetta . Londra ci ha accolti con una luminosa giornata di sole e l'arrivo alla casa di Nottingh Hill ha completato le nostre aspettative .<br/>Sarah e' una padrona di casa simpatica e gioviale , e l'alloggio e' molto accogliente e perfetto per chi come noi aveva voglia di sentirsi un po ' a casa , ma in un ambiente diverso . Nottingh Hill e' una zona tranquilla , ma veramente magica : le vie sempre cosi' silenziose , all'improvviso si riempiono di voci e profumi , il mercato si riempie in ogni angolo e da quelle casette cosi ' belle e colorate escono quelle persone che io cervavo di immaginare . <br/>Anche la nostra casa era una di loro, con gli stessi colori e dimensioni ed io mi sono sentita a casa .

51830,1093050,07-04-2012,1768242,Sally,"My husband and I rented this adorable flat with our 4-year-old son, who sarah brought Legos for. She is a great host - always there if we needed her, but otherwise left us alone :-) We ended up cooking dinner most nights and she had all the pots and pans we needed. I was nervous about using airbnb but this was a great first experience. "

51830,1830037,29-07-2012,2052027,James,"The overal experience with this flat has been absolutely great. <br/>The flat is located in one of the nicest areas of London. Close to transport and walking distance to the heart of Notting Hill, this certainly is one of the finest spots you can find in this wonderful city.<br/>Sarah's flat is really charming. It is on the second floor of a beautiful period building. It is very bright and simply, but tastefully decorated. It is very quiet (very I important in London) clean and bright. <br/>Sarah has been an absolutely fantastic host. The flat was spotless when we arrived and she even left some fresh food for us, such as milk and other basic supplies. <br/>We definitely recommend this place and we will stay again next time we are in London. <br/>"
51830,1918465,07-08-2012,2932940,Kashif,"Hi, <br/><br/>We were in London during Olympics and stayed at Sarah's place. We had an awesome time; the location is central to everything with the nearest tube and bus station a 3 minute walk away. There are great food places nearby incase you are too tired to go far.Sarah is an amazing host, every little detail was taken care of (including Chocolates and other food items for the guests!!) She even extended the check out time to accomadate our flight timings and last minute shopping! The flat is lovely and prefectly situated near Notting Hill. <br/>Totally recommended to fellow travellers!!!<br/><br/>For our next trip to London, we are definitely staying there again, If Sarah would have us:)!!<br/><br/>Cheers!<br/>Amber & Kashif"

51830,2172307,02-09-2012,2854923,Cat,"Sarah's apartment was the perfect accommodation for our week long stay in London. It is lovely and bright, in a storybook-London street, and we instantly felt at home. It really is a fantastic location, within easy walking distance to everything we needed - tube stations, bus stops, and supermarkets. I would definitely recommend staying here - the value for money is outstanding compared with a hotel in the same area. I can't say enough nice things about this apartment, it really was wonderful!"
51830,2303364,17-09-2012,433747,Indu,"We had a very good stay at Sarah's flat. Location was excellent and close ( 5 mins walk) to the tube station, apt was airy and well maintained and we had no problems at all. Would recommend highly."
51830,2390517,24-09-2012,2997367,Jo,"We loved our stay in Sarah's apartment: it is wonderful! The main reception room is huge with great natural light. Quiet, secure, two huge comfy couches; we felt like we were living there rather than visiting.<br/>Excellent location, transport links, shopping and eating options. <br/><br/>Sarah was easy to communicate with, quick and very accomodating with changes/requests. "
51830,2606466,14-10-2012,1102533,Kimberley,"This flat is conveniently located 5mins walk to a tube stop that connects in only 1 stop to Paddington, which makes it very convenient to take the Express train to/from Heathrow. It is about a 15mins walk to Portobello Market and also 15mins to Hyde Park (which both are lovely walks in the morning). Making arrangements with Sarah was super easy and quick. We were welcomed by her friend mid-evening who gave us a quick rundown of the flat. Also, Sarah was kind enough to have left us some food so we'd have something to eat in the morning. Lovely hosts and very convenient location."
51830,2668696,21-10-2012,2240378,Kay,"Well it was a case of not wanting to leave when our 7 days were up at Sarah's flat in Notting Hill. The location is fantastic so close to central London, the Tube, Overland trains, buses and the shopping, restaurants and local pubs all easily accessible by foot, and all most enjoyable as well.<br/><br/>The flat  has everything you could wish for, and with a choice of supermarkets so close by the in-house catering as supplied by ourselves was always great. Whilst it was cold and wet while we where in London, the flat was warm to come home to everyday, and we did not have to turn on central heating once. For those of you who enjoy your music, you can even go to soundcloud and search for Sarah Stanton and listen to some of Sarah's songs, how nice to know you are staying at a flat owned by someone so talented.<br/><br/>Sarah is a fantastic host, and on the day of arrival she helped us out with our bags until the flat was ready for us and then drove us over to the flat so we did not have to carry the bags, how awesome is that!<br/>"
51830,2718887,25-10-2012,3049928,Giulia,"The flat is lovely and fully equiped, in a beautiful and quiet area in the centre. 5 min walking and you find very good restaurants, shops and supermarkets. Sarah is really nice and available. My holiday couldn't have been better than that!"
51830,2807546,05-11-2012,1265406,Morry,We enjoyed our stay in Sarah's apartment very much. It was well located on a quiet street in Notting Hill with easy access to public transport when needed. Being walkers we often strolled through Hyde Park on our way to Kensington area and on to Central London. Sarah was responsive to any of our questions and very reliable to communicate with.
51830,2894282,16-11-2012,1560557,Penny,"Sarah was excellent in her communication and arrangements and organised for her friend to warmly welcome and introduce us to the apartment. We stayed for 10 days. Sarah kindly left us some food basics to keep us going, eg bread, eggs, milk etc. The apartment is in a great location, close to Underground, shops, restaurants and local attractions.It has everything you need if you want to be self sufficient.  There was a good sized living area, plenty of storage and conveniences eg washing machine, TV, good wireless internet etc. We had a great stay and this is a good apartment if you are planning a short or medium term stay in London."
51830,2964324,26-11-2012,3618469,Leandro,"The flat's location is very good. The nighbourhood has MANY options in terms of good restaurants and supermarkets, such as Planet Organic and Daylesford. Ottolenghi, which is some kind of a small deli, is another special place one shouldn't miss. We can't imagine a better neighbourhood to stay in London. There are three tube stations near the apartment and many bus stops. Sarah was kind enough to leave some fruits, coffee and bread for us. London is a great city and we reccomend staying at Sarah's flat."
51830,3024343,04-12-2012,3488619,Markus,"Sarah's apartment is in a great location just a few minutes walk from the tube. It's close to shops, pubs and restaurants. <br/><br/>We stayed four nights and found it more than adequate. The apartment is well furnished and was clean. We never actually met Sarah as she had her friend Rachel meet us for check-in. Rachel was very good despite us being late due to delays on the train. She showed us around the apartment and had supplied us with bread, milk, eggs and some fresh fruit. <br/><br/>The closest tube stop is Royal Oak and is within 5 minutes walk from the apartment. There are also bus and taxi services available.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again and would recommend Sarah and the apartment for either short or long stays. "
51830,3118723,19-12-2012,4076177,Meg,"Great location with all the amenities we needed!  Close proximity to the tube with wonderful grocery store and numerous pubs within walking distance.  Also, be sure not to miss the market!!  Sarah was a warm and gracious host who checked in more than once to be sure all was well.  Overall, we had a great time!"
51830,3273805,05-01-2013,3414146,Susan,"Our experience was great.<br/><br/>Sarah answered emailed questions  quickly.  Since our visit was in holiday time, she arranged an equally obliging substitute to greet us.  Emergency food supplies were provided for our first day since groceries were closed.<br/><br/>The flat is well-furnished and comfortable .  Shopping and transportation are nearby; there are many walk able destinations.<br/><br/>This was our first experience with AirBnB but will not be our last.<br/> "

51830,3383810,21-01-2013,1343156,Massimo,"Sarah's flat is just beautful. Located in a very nice neighborhood, the tube station is 2' away (walking), shops and restaurants are also within 5' distance.<br/>The flat was clean, warm and nice, and Sarah was very polite. <br/>I can only recommend it to anybody."
51830,3415772,26-01-2013,4553307,Emily,"Lovely apartment, would definitely recommend!"
51830,3599214,22-02-2013,4069218,Bruce,"We stayed at Sarah's for three weeks and highly recommend this flat.  We were met upon arrival at the flat which is a short cab ride from Paddington Station (easily accessible by train from Heathrow).  The flat is very comfortable and there were no surprises as the pictures on airbnb are truly representative.  The immediate neighborhood is a quiet very nice residential area with many stores and restaurants within a ten minute walk and a supermarket within a five minute walk.  One tube stop is a few minute walk with two others a ten minute or so walk.  Between the three, any area of London is accessible with at most one transfer.  While we had little need to communicate with Sarah during our stay, whenever we did she was incredibly responsive, even to the extent of purchasing a new lamp for our use.  If you are looking to stay in a wonderful neighborhood away from, but accessible to, the tourist  center of London, this is a wonderful choice.  "
51830,3738362,10-03-2013,1873626,Jon,"We had a great stay at Sarah's place in Notting Hill.  The pictures properly represented the flat.  The place is in a great, very quiet neighborhood -- close to the Portobello Market.  We used the Royal Oak tube stop to get around the city during our stay which was very convenient.  We were met by Rachel right when we arrived and were pleasantly surprised by some basic groceries -- bread, fruit, milk and eggs -- a very nice personal touch.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place looking to get a neighborhood feel while in London at reasonable rates.  Thanks much!"
51830,3790505,15-03-2013,5192054,Gregory,"My wife and I stayed in Sarah's flat for three days in March 2013. We were very comfortable and would recommend it subject to the following observations:<br/><br/>Pros: The flat is just what it appears in the photos. No fish-eye distortion. It is spacious and adequate for two. The living room is sunny and airy. The apartment is quiet. The hot water works well. The kitchen is well supplied. The heating was adequate.<br/><br/>The welcome gesture of providing a few provisions was greatly appreciated as we arrived hungry and disoriented.<br/><br/>The flat is five to ten minutes walk to a tube station and to a Waitrose supermarket. If you are going to cook for yourself, the latter is a big plus.<br/><br/>Cons: My wife, who was on her first visit to London, found the location a bit too suburban for a three-day stay. She would have preferred to be closer to or in the west end. I didn't share this qualm. Having been to London dozens of times, the most important thing for me was that the flat was close to a tube station.<br/><br/>This was my first time using Airbnb and I have one peeve. The final price of the stay, after adding cleaning and booking fee, comes to about 20% more than the initial offer price. It is still reasonable for London. But it comes as a bit of a bait and switch to the user.  I would urge Airbnb to be more transparent.<br/>"
51830,4103322,09-04-2013,4493984,Meg,"Fantastic Value for London! Great location, quiet street, friendly helpful people, clean, modern.  Left us milk, butter, bread, eggs, grapes, and anything worth holding over from other guests, like coffee, tea, sugar, salt, pepper, honey etc!  We travel alot, and are picky.  Meets our standards well enough for the price! Sarah and Zoe were great!  We would definitely stay here again!"
51830,4185940,16-04-2013,5661036,Felix,Perfect appartment. Great contact! Thank you very much!

Apartamento confortavel com todas comodidades possiveis, ao lado do metro, ao lado de excelente mercado e num bairro elegante, tranquilo, proximo a muitos restaurantes e linha de onibus 24 horas. Melhor, impossivel. A proprietaria eh super atenciosa."
51830,4907583,01-06-2013,6221522,Chris & Kat,Sarah's place is in a neat trendy area of London - conveniently located within a short walk of the Royal Oak tube station. The apartment is neat and spacious. There were some issues with the wifi connection however we were able to use free wifi available in the area with no issues. Communication was great with Sarah coming back very quickly on any enquiries we had. Would highly recommend a stay in Sarah's place. 
51830,5033727,09-06-2013,5456487,Sheena,"We very much enjoyed our week-long stay in this well-appointed, comfortably furnished and light-filled flat. Its situation was ideal for us--close to Paddington station and a very short stroll to tube, buses, shops, pubs and restaurants. The surrounding area is quiet and pleasant.<br/>The several flights of steep stairs that lead from the front door to the flat's entrance could be drawback for some people, but the leafy and attractive outlook that the flat's elevated position affords certainly compensates."
51830,5126363,14-06-2013,5369464,John,"Location okay but rather long walk to Portabello; as unit is in Tube zone 2 requires two transfers to most central London stops, which is time consuming.  Host provided fresh food to get us started and this was much appreciated.  Unit is maintained okay but has oddities such as bare light bulb sockets hanging from ceilings and some wall switches and electrical outlets that do not work and electrical outlets.  These types of things can use some attention.  Unit oddly lacks table at which to dine.  A rather large plant sits in the corner where a table should be.  Only flat surface to dine is low coffee table.  Unit clean enough although a rather moldy shower stall is a bit gross.  Reminded us of the tropics.  Location fairly quiet unless upstairs neighbor is banging about at 1am which prevents a good sleep.  Be prepared to lug bags up three flights of stairs.  All in all a good place to stay with the above caveats.<br/><br/>"
51830,5746116,15-07-2013,3444917,Margot,The best possible London base for us! A home-away-from-home to return to with everything one could want when Travelling. Sarah has thought of everything to ensure a comfortable stay in her light and bright apartment. We hope we can stay there next time we visit London.
51830,6453935,13-08-2013,5507003,John,"First of all, location is great. 3 minutes walk to Royal Oak Tube station and in a very nice corner of Notting Hill. Even Portobello Road and Queensway are 15 minutes walk or two bus stops away.  Considering that this is London, space wise is OK. We found the flat to be very clean, welcoming and a nice touch were the groceries that Sarah had bought for us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend this flat to anyone visiting London. "
51830,17003798,05-08-2014,7562373,Zainab,"My husband and I stayed at Sarah's flat for 9 days end July- beg August 2014. Our 4 year old son and 10 month old daughter were with us.<br/>We were met at the flat by Sarah who kindly spent a lot of time answering all our questions and telling us abt the neighbourhood. The flat was also fully equipped with all essentials and breakfast items. The flat was a bit smaller than it had looked in the pics but was very clean and well maintained. Sarah was very kind to give our son 2 tubs of her son's toys to play with while we were there.<br/>The flat was a walk up on the 2nd floor. The kitchen/lounge is the main room and has the double bed. It was South facing and had great light. The other room was small with a single elevated bed over a desk. <br/>The location was excellent. Very close to royal oak tube and within mins of many buses. Waitrose was a 5 min walk and planet organic was 10 mins away. Westbourne grove street had plenty of cafes and restaurant to choose from. Notting hill was a 10 min walk and Hyde park was 15. <br/>All in all we had a great experience at Sarah's flat and would definitely stay there again.<br/>"
51830,17160489,08-08-2014,3748952,Kirsten,"Lovely flat in a good location!  The neighbourhood is really nice and quiet, but still only a few minutes' walk to restaurants and shops.  <br/>The flat was very clean and had everything we needed.  We had a great visit!<br/>"
51830,17634352,15-08-2014,14521728,Colleen,"Absolutely perfect location for sight seeing London followed by restful sleeps.  Sarah's apartment has everything for a comfortable stay.  Her friend, Zoe greeted us upon our arrival and provided clear instructions and directions to necessary things like grocery stores, tube stations and bus stops.  The apartment is clean, very bright and airy with large windows. The additional bed in a separate room is very handy for young children/teen and very appreciated by my teenage daughter so she had privacy.  The apartment is located in a very peaceful, safe neighbourhood as it is set back one street behind others more travelled.  It's a 5 minute walk to Royal Oak tube station on the Circle Line so travel is straight into central London and all major sites with easy line transfers to anywhere else too.  There are many local bus stops in the neighbourhood within 5 mins walk, as well as a Waitrose grocery store.  It's also located minutes on foot to a vibrant local neighbourhood filled with shopping, restaurants, pubs, and more.<br/>We loved our stay and would definitely return.  Thank you Sarah for making our trip a memorable one."
51830,24535210,30-12-2014,3565816,Abi,We stayed in Sarah's flat for Christmas and it was just splendid. She was very friendly and her place is well decorated and spacious and very central. I will definitely recommend this apartment!
51830,24917003,04-01-2015,3859445,Lucinda,We really liked the flat and Sarah made us very welcome on our arrival. It is in a great location and is just as advertised. There were some problems with the heating and hot water and Sarah was very prompt and attentive in dealing with these issues. We very much enjoyed our stay and would return. 
51830,29285480,06-04-2015,28002920,Barbara,"Sarah was very welcoming.   A  friend of hers helped cart our bags up to the third floor and that was sweet.  The refrigerator held enough food to get us nicely started during our six night stay and there was tea and coffee. Conversely we were short on bun wipe, garbage bags and a hot shower the last morning.  The television was nice and the furnishing made for easy lounging. The listing is accurate and the host should not be faulted for providing a photo that shows the flat in its best light.  The neighborhood is positively stunning and quite posh.  Five minute walk to the bus, ten to excellent nearby restaurants and a Marks and Spencers, and maybe fifteen to Bayswater Tube Stop. Kensington Park and Palace are just a bit farther and then one is in another interesting neighborhood.  Hyde Park adjoins Kensington. "
51830,29835058,13-04-2015,28396306,Ken,"I stayed in Sarah’s flat for a week with my 13 year old son in April. We had a busy week planned visiting many sights in and around London and Sarah’s flat was well positioned to achieve that. The underground is only a 5 minute walk, there are many shops and restaurants only a few streets away and Paddington is just 5 minutes in a taxi. Despite all that, the flat sits in a quiet street and being upstairs it felt secure. The lounge/kitchen is large and bright with big south facing windows, the beds were very comfortable and all the facilities worked as expected. Sarah helped a lot by responding quickly to some questions that I had about the local area and everything was well organised. My son thought the flat was “very cool” and I would definitely recommend it if you want to stay in a good area with good local facilities and which also allows quick and easy access to the centre of London.      "
51830,39149561,21-07-2015,17322915,Ruth,Sarah was great and explained everything. Fabulous location within walking distance to portobello road and the tube and buses nearby. only a 10 minutes walk to Kensington gardens. Very quiet and private. Great for 2 people.
51830,40204446,29-07-2015,30879883,Rosanne,"My son and I had a lovely stay in Sarah’s flat for our first trip to London. The neighborhood is beautiful, with lots of shops and restaurants nearby, and access to multiple tube stations for easy access to all of London. It was a perfect base for us to explore this vibrant city.<br/><br/>Sarah’s communication with us prior to the trip was clear and prompt, and she checked in with us during our stay to make sure we were doing fine. She was very accommodating on arrival time and had Rachel meet us at the flat based on our train schedule.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean, comfortable, and quiet. The WiFi worked well, and it was convenient to have a kitchen and a clothes washer. The description is accurate, but the photos need to be updated to show that the queen bed is in the living area and the bed in the bedroom is a raised single bed, which you access via a small ladder and is quite comfortable.<br/><br/>We had a very pleasant stay and would recommend Sarah’s flat as a comfortable and convenient base for exploring London.<br/>"

Plus there's laundry, which is a total lifesaver on a longer trip. Sarah herself was a great host, and even stocked the kitchen with some starter items for us.<br/><br/>If you're going to be in London, you really can't do better!"
51830,48431368,26-09-2015,43281520,Yan,Sarah is an awesome host. During check out we left 1 of our hand carry bags locked inside the flat and Sarah drive all the way down to unlock the doors for us again. Will definitely stay at her place again the next time we came to london.
51830,51332832,19-10-2015,5573460,Barbara,"Sarah's place is in a beautiful house in a very quiet street, just a few minutes to the tube station. A five minutes walk brings you to some great restaurants, cafés and farmers market which is great for breakfast. Also nice to go running. The apartment is cozy, spacious and very light, with the most comfortable bed I ever found in an airbnb. The apartment has everything you need. But above all it has the most wonderful host. Sarah greeted me and showed me everything, including the super fast wifi. And she was so sweet to leave coffee, milk and fruits. Communications was perfect, before and during my stay. I highly recommend Sarah's place and hope it will be free upon my next London visit. "

Grocery stores, restaurants, pubs, shops, cafes, bakeries, Portobello market and Kensington park are all in the range of a 10-25 minutes walk. The tube station is very close too. And yet the flat is in a quiet picturesque street. Note that the flat in on the second floor and the staircase steep, though short.<br/>Sarah was very helpful with any request and responded immediately to our questions.<br/>My husband and I stayed with my 12 year old son and the space was comfortable and convenient.<br/>We highly recommend staying at Sarah's place.<br/>"

51830,58277619,02-01-2016,12683585,Iñaki,"El piso esta muy bien situado, en un entorno residencial muy tranquilo, pero a menos de 5 minutos a pie hay restaurantes y supermercados, así como la parada de metro y autobuses. <br/>La anfitriona no pudimos estar con ella directamente pero nos dejo las instrucciones a través de una chica que nos atendió y estaba accesible por correo y teléfono, aunque no tuvimos que consultar nada porque no tuvimos ninguna necesidad especial. <br/>La casa esta bien equipada para una estancia vacacional (horno, microondas,) y todo funciona correctamente. El WIFI sin problemas, TV, etc.<br/>Lo recomiendo para parejas solas o con algún hijo.<br/>"
51830,59355728,10-01-2016,12711943,Georgie,"Sarah was a lovely host. She met us at the apartment and showed us how everything worked. She also had a few groceries for us which was really nice. Apartment is clean and as described, it was perfect for my mum and I to stay in for 8 nights. Neighbourhood is so pretty and you are close to a few tube stations."
51830,63125140,20-02-2016,5038803,Kevin,Sarah's flat was a perfect home for staying on the west side. I highly recommend it!
51830,66714357,24-03-2016,48456937,Frank,"Sarah was great, she showed me around and left detailed notes on everything. The place is terrific for a number of reasons 1) Very central location with short walks to three underground stations and Paddington Station (terminus of Heathrow Express).  2) Central, yet really quiet. The only cars Durham Terrace are residents - zero cut through traffic. 3) The main room in Sarah's flat has to huge windows facing south, so really great natural light. 4) The Bayswater/Noting Hill area has nearby shops, restaurants and pubs.  I would recommend Sarah's place and hope to book again "
51830,67902222,01-04-2016,998077,Janet,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The location is fantastic - walking distance to lots of great restaurants, pubs, and shopping - but very quiet. Although we didn't meet Sarah personally, she was very accommodating of our schedule. "

51830,78992564,10-06-2016,61159291,Caroline,"It was my first trip to London. I was meeting up with my 22 year old daughter who was also travelling to London for the first time. It was also my first time booking Airbnb, so the whole experience was new to me. But I can thoroughly recommend Sarah's flat. I needn't have worried.<br/>Firstly, my flight was arriving at 7am, and after a 24 hour flight from Sydney I was worried about where I could leave my bag before checkin later in the day. Sarah was able to accommodate me with an early checkin. Whilst she was not there is person, she arranged for a friend to be there.<br/>The flat is on the top floor of a typical Notting Hill terrace. Everything is as advertised. Gorgeous outlook, terrific, quiet, safe location. Easy walk to 2 stations on the tube on different lines which made our daily trips even easier. Bus stop was also very close.<br/>Kitchen is very well equipped so cooking in the flat was easy. Sarah had stocked the fridge with some basics which were greatly appreciated. Great supermarket, Waitrose, was the few minutes away which sold good quality fresh foods, meat, seafood, fruit & veg, breads, etc. open until 10pm most nights.<br/>Wifi and Skytv were great. Lounge super comfy. Washing machine efficient and we appreciate a rack for drying. <br/>We had a fantastic stay in London, made all the better by the Sarah's flat! Would book again without hesitation!<br/>Caroline<br/>"
51830,81848371,25-06-2016,14524522,Kristin,Sarah's place was great! Good location with convenient underground/tube stations nearby in a few different directions. Her flat was warm and inviting. She responded quickly to any questions I had and reached out before we got there to make sure things were set up for us. A quiet neighborhood but not too far from everything! I would definitely stay again and recommend it to others!
51830,83623807,03-07-2016,27819488,Conrad,"It was like staying in an artist loft in a classic London period flat. Very spacious , quiet neighborhood , and close to tube stations. I highly recommend it."
51830,84721278,08-07-2016,57463694,Melissa,"This was our first Airbnb experience and first trip to London. Sarah was very welcoming and made the process easy for us. Her flat is beautiful, bright and spacious. It was perfect for my husband, my daughter and me. The neighbourhood is picturesque and easy walking distance to the tube. There are also tons of restaurants and other amenities nearby. If we are lucky enough to return to London one day, we'd love to stay again. Highly recommended!!"
51830,87459038,20-07-2016,50718333,Andrew,"The flat is delightful and convenient, exactly has advertised.  Easy walking distance to Portobello Road and Royal Oak Underground station.

51830,90423969,01-08-2016,66972342,Karyn,"Sarah was prompt in her response and information. She was there at check in, and did a lovely run down on the apartment. The apartment was a lovely family flat where Sarah lives, when not offering up to guests,  and is great for a mom with a teen. The pictures are actually off, as her couches are now around her coffee table, and the double bed is in the same room. Otherwise, it is just as beautiful as it looks. Quite spacious for this great Notting Hill location. Wonderful place to stay."
51830,92916565,10-08-2016,15541211,Heather,Sarah was very accommodating with our arrival time and let us check in early. She was always quick to respond when I had a question. The flat is in a good location - quiet road but very near Queensway/Westbourne Grove and Paddington. Very light and airy. The only surprise was that the double bed is in the living room and there is a bunk bed in the bedroom but it worked well for us as I was travelling with my son. 
51830,94605016,16-08-2016,65968751,Lisa,"Sarah and her helper Sophie were wonderful, very nice and welcoming and accommodating. The location was fantastic. It is about a 5 minute walk to the nearest Tube station. I would definitely stay there again without hesitation."

As described it was minutes from Paddington station. I was near the carnival route and close to several tube stations. Any eateries and places to shop were within walking distance. <br/>With the exception of the loud construction that resumed after the bank holiday, I loved the place. Sarah was easily accessible when I had problems or questions. And she was gracious enough to leave a semi stocked fridge for me which was a pleasant surprise!   I would definitely stay by Sarah again!"
51830,100566164,10-09-2016,9019523,Alicia,"Sarah made sure that we were welcomed by a friend while she was away.

She is warm and friendly, and we enjoyed the lovely neighborhood and the spaciousness and light of the flat."

We would be happy to book it again any time. Sarah herself was out of town but put us in the safe and gentle care of Peter. Communication was easy with both of them. Remarks: The wifi was ok but not excellent. The shower hook need repair.

Highly recomendable!
51830,156589084,31-05-2017,25461698,Jim,"Sarah's place is a modern, clean and quiet flat in a lovely neighborhood with few tourists. WiFi and TV are easy to use. The double bed in the living room is comfortable, and the kitchen is well equipped. <br/>The Royal Oak underground station is close by, and there's a large Waitrose supermarket and a great restaurant row a few blocks away on Westbourne Grove. Little Venice is a short walk north, with paths along the canals. <br/>Sarah is friendly and easy to reach, and we found the flat a perfect base for the two of us to explore London."

The apartment, while small, is perfectly equipped with everything a person would need - including a bath. Sarah left provisions for us, and we spent the weekend exploring the local area. The flat is within walking distance to all the lovely things in Notting Hill as well as two tube stations."
51830,179435573,07-08-2017,3431414,Danny,Great location - quiet and close to restaurants and the Royal Oak tube station.

51830,296585365,26-07-2018,31324814,Nicola,Sarah’s apartment is in a lovely quiet neighbourhood with shops and transport in easy walking distance.  All communications with Sarah were timely and she was offered solutions when I mentioned we were leaving the UK that day and had two large suitcases that we couldn’t drag around with us!<br/>During our stay there were works happening outside the building however when it had wrapped for the day it was evident that the area was quiet and safe.<br/>The raised single bed in the second bedroom requires climbing a ladder so may prove difficult for some guests.However the double bed in the living area is comfortable and there’s a nice big couch to rest after a busy day in London.
51830,298324355,29-07-2018,104033498,Chelsea,"perfect location and place to stay, search is quite kind and easygoing, wonderful stay!!"

51830,366846201,03-01-2019,2771145,Satya,"Sarah’s place was fantastic for our stay. The Notting Hill area is wonderful, clean and quite conveniently located. The Underground stop was a 5-7 min walk away and the apartment was spotlessly clean. She is extremely thoughtful and left us some bread, eggs and milk. Her was super prompt with her communication and very friendly. I would definitely stay here again, if I go back to London!"
51830,440801035,21-04-2019,48877127,Joanne,"Sarah's Notting Hill flat is in a nice quiet area.  There are many shops and restaurants in a 5-10 minute walk.  There are also a few supermarkets very close by.  Please note that this is a 4th floor walk up.  Sarah is very good at responding and she did leave some bread, butter, milk and juice which was very nice."

51830,461845696,01-06-2019,409667,Francisco,"Sarah was super friendly and helped us out with all our doubts and inquiries before arrival. The neighborhood is beautiful. The apartment is located in a typical street of the early 1900s with terraced houses. Only 5 minutes walk to a Circle line underground stop. Check-in was smooth and we got into the very spacious lounge with a double bed, a sofa, a TV, the fully equipped kitchen, and a foldable table with two chairs. Sarah even left some basic food for us in the fridge.<br/>The bathroom is small and has a mini sink. Little space to leave the personal bathroom stuff. <br/>The bedroom has a child's bunker bed which wasn't shown in the Airbnb description, so be prepared for a ladder to access the bed. <br/>All in all I would recommend Sarah's apartment."

It’s a nice cosy neighbourhood not too far from the city and sights. A good place to base your trip if you prefer a quieter and more private place. The flat is fully equipped if you like doing some cooking and laundering your clothes while there. Spacious enough for a couple of family of 3 as there is a sofa bed. Thank you again Sarah!!"

Two tube stations serve it so getting to other parts of the city is easy. The check-in was great too and we were met outside the building and given a few local tips on where to get some much needed coffee!

55402,346591829,09-11-2018,105420104,Atilla,"Beth was a great host. She was super kind and friendly. Her flat is in a newly built apartment complex with free secured car-parking. The insulation of the building was so good that we barely turn-on the boiler. It's in walking distance to all amenities and shopping centres including a mega Sainsbury, Decathlon and even Ikea. Tram is in 1 minute  walking distance. You can hop-on in every 5 minutes and when you hop-off at East Croydon you can connect to London Bridge literally in 13 minutes. Gatwick is also 1 stop away from East Croydon via Thameslink which is super convenient. I highly recommend this place to basically anyone from professionals to families as it comes with 2 well-sized bedrooms and two bathrooms."

Its location is incredibly convenient, with the tram station right next to the apartment, making it easy to reach the city center. Additionally, there are several supermarkets within walking distance, including Sainsbury's and M&S.<br/>Beth, the host, is exceptionally warm and accommodating. She goes above and beyond to meet any requests. Both my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed our time here. Thank you for a wonderful experience!"
55402,1.01587E+18,02-11-2023,542863484,Karthik,"Beth was so friendly and always responded quickly, check in and out was easy and the place was lovely. In all honesty we didn’t want to leave! Two tram stations right near by taking you to East Croydon where there’s a straight train into London- we went into London twice and our journey was 30 mins only. Also lots of shops nearby. Can’t wait to come back!"

56229,140484,16-11-2010,281934,Jan Danilo,"The stay in Boris' studio flats was very pleasant. The room was very clean and not noisy at all. Furthermore, Boris is very helpful. The experience was much better than most low budget hotels in London can offer. Hammersmith is close to the city by tube and offers a variety of very nice pubs. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend Boris' studio to everyone.   "

56229,199693,15-03-2011,359814,Camilla,Very clean and comfortable accommodation:) This studio is small but well furnished. There is everything you need. Boris is a great host: always kind and helpful. We have had a great time here. The surrounding area is quiet and pretty. The house is perfectly located a few minutes walk from Hammersmith tube station and the King's Mall.

Excellent standard and a decent price, Boris & his wife are lovely and very accomodating, i have reccomended this to my colleagues to stay when they have to come to London."
56229,2377022,22-09-2012,2576331,Nigel,"This was a fantastic Airbnb experience - Boris replied really quickly, accommodated my changing arrival time, and met me as planned at the property. He's a really friendly guy too. The room was exactly as advertised, really clean, comfortable, quiet, great shower... I was only staying for 1 night so wasn't too worried about things like storage, but I noticed that there was a pretty decent-sized  wardrobe that would definitely have been big enough for a large suitcase, so would be ideal for longer stays too. All in all, I can't fault a single thing about it. Boris's studios will be top of my list whenever I need to be in London in the future. Thanks!"
56229,5597122,08-07-2013,4681321,Cherry,"The location is perfect for seeing London's many tourist attractions, it's approx. 20-30 minutes from central London and Heathrow.  The apartment is only 5 minutes walk from the Hammersmith tube station and other public transportations, very convenient for exploring the area.  20 minutes walk to one of the largest shopping mall where you can shop until you drop with restaurants and bar/pubs galore to relax should you need to rest in between shopping.<br/>The apartment is very clean and well equipped for all you need. The host were very polite and helpful for any enquires you might have for places to eat or places to visit.<br/><br/>I recommend this place to anyone visiting London."

Borris and his wife were good hosts. They allowed us to store our luggage when we arrived early which was a big help to us. They also have a very friendly Cavalier named Buster who greeted us warmly when we arrived :)
56229,14784025,26-06-2014,15415127,Jayma,"This studio was perfect for what we were looking for - somewhere in Hammersmith, close to the tubes and value for money. We were pleasantly surprised by the studio - it had everything we needed. Boris was really friendly, helping with the luggage and any other questions we had. Would definitely stay here again. "
56229,15570050,12-07-2014,13240033,Loren,"This is a very nice place to stay and less expensive than being in downtown London. The place is almost a hotel because it has maid service and a reception area. It is tastefully decorated, clean, and relatively quiet. The internet service was good. Boris is very nice and helpful. Hammersmith is a fun area to hang out in. It has great pubs and shops and the place is right near a tube station. The only thing to be aware of is that during the day there was construction noise from a new building across the street, but it looks like it will be done in a month or two and you probably wont be there during the day anyway."

56229,19721247,17-09-2014,7392668,Jill,"The studio flat was one room in a house that had been converted into a  rental property with several suites. The sloped ceilings should have been my indicator that it was the top floor of this old home which was difficult for me to lug my suitcase up. <br/>Once there, however, the too<br/> was even lovelier than the pictures: clean, modern, pretty, and thoughtful details likes chocolates on the pillows, tea bags and biscuits, and a hair dryer. <br/>His wife was there to greet me and assist me upon arrival as it is run like a B&B/hotel. <br/>Well situed in London but because of its location, it was noisy, especially with a major construction project across the street. Nevertheless, I would recommend a stay at Boris' studio flat. "
56229,19882372,20-09-2014,19963766,Caroline,"Very conveniently situated minutes from Hammersmith tube and Apollo theatre. Friendly reception staff. Apartment was perfect for what we wanted - comfortable, clean with will appointed self catering facilities. Would definitely stay here again."
56229,20178224,25-09-2014,13628602,Daniel,"Great neighborhood, really friendly welcome, and a fantastic little apartment, just what we wanted!"
56229,20311596,27-09-2014,20364323,Dee,As I don't know around London so much was not expecting that Hammersmith will be so close to everything and as it was my first airbnb I was so glad I did it.  Boris is helpful and his appartement so welcoming clean and beautiful
56229,20545414,01-10-2014,13914688,Mitzi,"Felt really welcome, exterior, reception room and halls were very smart. Room was fantastic and provided all you needed for a long or short stay - great shower, cooking and eating facilities all well negotiated within a clean and tidy three-bed room (with really comfy beds!) with WIFI. Location great and just a 5 minutes walk from the Hammersmith tube station, if that. Area has highstreet shops and restaurants or pubs and street food restaurants all really close by. About a ten minute walk away, there are some really nice places to eat and drink on the Thames overlooking Hammersmith Bridge.  Thanks Boris!"
56229,21504250,19-10-2014,3844345,Lillian,"Had a great stay in London. Boris was very helpful with anything we needed. Great area, close to trains and everything you need."

56229,24308627,25-12-2014,4896205,Patrick,Boris's studio apartment was a great experience. The studio was very clean and cozy. It is a great location in Hammersmith. We stayed over Christmas eve and had a great time. Boris and his family were very nice and sweet. They set up a taxi for us. It was very nice meeting Boris and family. Thank you. 
56229,25374452,13-01-2015,16686585,Derek,Arrived at 8pm and host was very pleasant and efficient.  The studio apartment was exactly as described on website.  It appeared to have been recently decorated and very clean throughout. I've stayed in this area a few times but been very unlucky with my choice of accommodation in the past.  I will certainly stay next time I'm in town.
56229,28531806,25-03-2015,24114786,Max,"Really good stay - the room was a lot more spacious than I had expected and it made for a relaxing time. The staff were super friendly and lovely.  If you are going to a show at the Hammersmith Apollo, this is a good place to stay overnight."

56229,39623080,25-07-2015,25126110,Lilian,I booked this place for my elderly parents who were visiting from abroad. Boris was a lovely host and the accommodation was spot on. Definitely recommended!!
56229,42841254,16-08-2015,33777930,Sarah,"This is a fantastic apartment (small like most in London) but very clean and in a good location. Boris was helpful and friendly when we arrived. I would stay at this apartment again. The local area has a few good restaurants and a bit of shopping, but the location to the underground made it super easy to get anywhere. "
56229,44524757,27-08-2015,34095327,Eliza,"Had a great stay, was a really nice area! A couple minute walk to the shops, cafes and the train. Very clean and quiet. Even nicer than the photos show, must have been redone since photos have gone up. Would highly recommend. "
56229,46535431,11-09-2015,43079409,David,I stayed at Boris' studio for a couple of days. Great location and very confortable. I'll definitely be back again.

56229,47983536,22-09-2015,33913479,Terhi,"Asunto oli kuvauksen mukainen. Juuri sopiva kahdelle ihmiselle viikon mittaiselle oleskelulle. Hyvin varusteltu ja hyvällä paikalla lähellä julkisia kulkuyhteyksiä. Alue oli rauhallinen, mutta kuitenkin lähellä ostos- ja ruokapaikkoja. <br/><br/>Vastaanotto oli hyvä ja lämmin. Sisään- ja uloskirjaus oli liukuva, joka sopii myöhään ja aikasin tulijoille/lähtijöille. <br/><br/>Ehdottomasti voidaan suositella muillekin! "
56229,57211412,23-12-2015,47233089,Annette,Grest place so handy to everything.  The staff were lovely and my room was cleaned daily.  I highly recommend this as a place to stay.  
56229,62227819,12-02-2016,30367224,Alex,Boris is a great host and he met me at the property. The room was a different but is also was lovely. I really had a good stay. The place is quite and will definitely recommend it! Thanks Boris!

56229,88873566,25-07-2016,28940241,Carol,"Despite planning to arrive at 7pm our flight delay meant we could not make it until 5am the following morning. Boris arranged to leave the key at a neighbouring hotel for us. As our bags had gone missing Boris's wife was very helpful allowing us to use their phone to follow up. The studio is in a great location - easy walk to the station, great shops and pubs and also down to the Thames. The studio is small but has all that is required. It was immaculately clean and serviced daily if required. Would definitely return."
56229,653354842,19-08-2020,180312425,Amrit,"Very good value for money and amazing hosts. Don’t was your money around Hammersmith, stay here."
56229,716757352,20-12-2020,33048264,Pablo,"Such a great place in a great location with some great hostess like Dusica and Boris.  My room was number 1, right at the top of the house so keep in mind this if you pack some heavy stuff, you will have to endure the stairs up there. The studio is pretty nice sized you have a kitchen with everything you need including dishes and cutlery, fridge, toaster, microwave and electric oven and electric kettle. The bathroom is pretty nice sized too. Two downsides that pretty is a shame for such a nice setting is the only window you have faces a wall. On the other hand, Dusica was extremely helpful letting me stay some more days as London lockdown Tiers changed by the hour. You get an amazing place in a great location with such a great price! Recomended!"
56229,719088155,28-12-2020,241837653,Yann,It is a really good place to stay. It was really clean and we had everything we need. Well located and not far from buses and underground station.
56229,739355970,15-03-2021,243344166,Marko,I have no complaints. The apartment was quiet and cozy. Everything was as advertised. Boris and Dusica were more than helpful and kind. Highly recommended.

56229,5.5341E+17,02-02-2022,8089543,Bob And Suzanne,"Boris was very responsive to our very last minute booking request and questions.  The location was so convenient!  Only 6 min walk from the Underground, we could be at the palace in 25 minutes or the airport in 30! The flat was clean and fresh! The neighborhood was peaceful and well kept The stairs into the property are steep and up to the room are plentiful, so if you have bad knees, or heavy bags, ask for the lowest floor! Boris was kind to help us with ours!"
56229,5.64289E+17,17-02-2022,97547216,Grace,"I liked it a lot, although the bathroom light was a little dim (but very minor). It was a well-presented studio and I would love to book again"
56229,5.70153E+17,25-02-2022,40395912,Aristeo,Un appartement correct et sobrement aménagé pour un bref séjour londonien. Nous avons été cordialement accueillis ici.

Il est facilement accessible via les transports en communs.<br/>Le logement est propre et fonctionnel avec tout le nécessaire. Le quartier d’Hammersmith est également agréable pour boire un verre et se restaurer ! <br/>Je recommande ce logement !
56229,6.04162E+17,13-04-2022,20457290,Doubravka,"The flat is about 5 minute walk from the undeground station. There are lots of cafes and shops in this part of London. The room is not big, but it spacious enough to enclude everything you need."

56229,6.57098E+17,25-06-2022,7904805,Tomas,"Very pleased with my stay. Small studio with everything one or two people might need. Great location next to Hammersmith Station, shopping malls, restaurants, groceries and more."
56229,6.74412E+17,19-07-2022,61719353,Adam,"Excellent value and location, walking distance from 4 different underground lines. Boris was an excellent host and made our stay very comfortable. He promptly responded to questions and made the check in and check out process very easy. I highly recommend this to others, and this is the first place I would look at again to stay if/when I come back to London in the future. Be aware that there is a narrow winding stairway to reach the rooms, so someone with mobility limitations may have to look at other options."
56229,6.79516E+17,26-07-2022,186026239,Nozomi,お世話になりました。立地条件は抜群で、駅から徒歩5分くらいで到着します。近くにはスーパーが2つあり、IKEYAやZARAもあります。<br/>ハマースミス駅は空港からも30分程度で到着し、観光をするにしても交通の便がかなりいいと思います。<br/>階段が思ってるよりあるので、最上階(屋根裏)の方は荷物を運ぶのに少し苦労するかもしれません。<br/>小さな蟻が結構いたのが少し気になりました。ガスコンロの使い方も難しかったです。
56229,7.10008E+17,06-09-2022,172728179,Capa,This is a great place to stay. The location is perfect and the space is great for two people.

56229,7.25192E+17,27-09-2022,19779029,Jessica,Super quick to respond. We were able to drop off luggage early which was amazing. Location is great. Not in the center of town but a 5 min walk to large metro (underground) station so very easy to get to and from.
56229,7.28094E+17,01-10-2022,9922291,Surya,"everything was fine and clean, the metro station is really near, I recommend this apartment"

56229,7.382E+17,15-10-2022,241293918,Katja,"Das Appartment ist fünf Minuten von der  U- Bahn Hammersmith. Es führen vier Linien und viele Busse in die Stadt. Ein idealer Ausgangsort.  Hammersmith selbst hat viele Kneipen und Cafes und man kann toll an der Themse  entlang spazieren. Das Studio ist ruhig, funktional eingerichtet und bietet eine Kochgelegenheit. Vom Fenster sieht man nur den Spalt zwischen den Häusern. Für jemanden, der einen super Standort, ein sehr gutes Preis-Leistungsverhältnis und einen sehr freundlichen Gastgeber sucht, genau das Richtige."
56229,7.40397E+17,18-10-2022,248071306,Liron,"Very basic clean apartment in a very good location for travelers on a budget. The building is very cute, the host - Peter was very kind, the location is good (four underground stations within a walking distance, cafès, restaurants and bar are in the area. Only 20 minutes from city center).<br/>We feel that our money was well invested. I will definitely book this apartment again if i go back to London."
56229,7.49205E+17,30-10-2022,355735596,Leonardo,Todo perfecto!
56229,7.54255E+17,06-11-2022,352863524,Léa,"Very well-located studio on the 3rd floor of a typical English house. Hammersmith is a lovely place to stay, with 4 underground lines going to Central London and plenty of shops all around. If you're coming from either Heathrow or St. Pancras/King's Cross/Euston railway, there's one same underground line which is only a 5-minute walk from the studio. In around 30/40 minutes you can easily go to central London and the most famous places. <br/>Neighbours were quiet during our stay but I recommend you bring earplugs just in case as walls are quite thin. <br/>Boris was a nice host, don't hesitate to ask him questions before your arrival or during your stay! 😊"
56229,7.58541E+17,12-11-2022,217176874,Céline,"Studio conforme à la description. Il est idéalement situé, à quelques pas de la station de métro et est adéquat pour un court séjour. L’arrivée sur place était simple et la communication très bonne."

Easy to find the host in person instead of using the text message function in airbnb. Future travellers do note that you need to walk up three floors of stairs. Overall great value of money!"
56229,7.94776E+17,01-01-2023,175489795,Fanny,"Bon rapport qualité-prix pour ce logement. Amplement suffisant pour un séjour de quelques jours. L'emplacement est idéal, avec le métro à 5 minutes à pied et un grand choix de restaurant et bars. Petits points négatifs : le matelas et des murs assez fins."
56229,8.34724E+17,25-02-2023,487046832,Friedrich,"Boris war nicht da; ich bekam nicht das gebuchte Zimmer, das wurde von einer Mitarbeiterin bestätigt mit den Worten: Ihr habt jetzt sowieso das bessere Zimmer! Verhalten des Vermieters: Egal ob sauber oder nicht, die Leute kommen sowieso und bezahlen! Ich empfehle Boris nicht und fühle mich betrogen!!"

Walking distance to  the tube, delicious places to eat around town and being able to walk to locations. We highly recommend staying here."
56229,8.78113E+17,26-04-2023,188814178,Guillaume,"The studio is pleasant. A little bit small if you are there during the day but perfect for sleeping. Very noisy environment due to transport mainly. A slight problem with ants at the beginning of the stay but this was quickly resolved, Boris is very responsive. The location is ideal, a stone's throw from Hammersmith station and the area is quiet with some good pubs and restaurants."
56229,8.86041E+17,07-05-2023,204307863,Diego,"The location was incredible! Boris and his family were very nice. They were all very responsive. Everything was clean and tidy. The only issue was the fact that we specifically said that we would have a baby with us. And our studio was on the fourth floor of the building. That wasn’t clear for us on the ad. We had to climb three flights of stairs to get there. The stairs were too narrow so we had to leave our buggy in the hall. If we had been placed in a studio on the first floor, everything would have been perfect! The odds were much stronger than the cons, though! Boris is a very good host. And his place is fantastic."
56229,8.89037E+17,11-05-2023,345092482,Stan,Nous avons était très bien accueillis à notre arrivé . Le logement est bien situé <br/>Bon rapport qualité prix
56229,9.02773E+17,30-05-2023,22142642,Bruce,the place is very easy rail access to heathrow. easy to find. I am a senior so climb to my room was difficult and with luggage nearly impossible
56229,9.12249E+17,12-06-2023,249544356,Rebecca,Lovely neighborhood and room to stay in. The hosts were friendly and very responsive. Everything was as described and matched the photos/description - we had a great view from our room. Bed was okay for a few nights - for the price it was exactly what we needed/expected.
56229,9.1723E+17,19-06-2023,495798690,Michael,"Excellent helpful host who provided the amenities as stated. Whilst it was stated that the room was on an upper level, the stairs would nearly be impossible for an aged person or anyone with a disability to climb with bags. Would recommend in Summer to pay the additional cost for AC."
56229,9.30362E+17,07-07-2023,495798690,Michael,"This is in an excellent location and is very good value for money. The hosts are personable and easy to deal with. Whilst they did clearly point out that the studio was on the third floor, if you are an older person or have any disability this is not for you. I truly struggled hauling suit cases up the stairs."
56229,9.34647E+17,13-07-2023,268957283,Lauren,great place to stay! would definitely recommend:)
56229,9.49903E+17,03-08-2023,116687902,Philip,Great location as it has three tube lines plus a huge bus terminal only minutes away. And a very short walk through the parking garage to the supermarkets and other shops. Lovely walk down to the river. We had a very small room in the attic but it worked well. The bed was not to our liking being a double futon and uncomfortable. The kitchen came with all necessary accessories which was good as we cooked there often. Our hostess was very kind and helpful. We would stay there again.
56229,9.62951E+17,21-08-2023,8351026,Lucia,The location is really good because it is only a few minutes from the Underground (in about 20 minutes you are in the centre of London).Suitable mainly for short tourist stays. Boris always very kind and helpful :)

56229,1.02238E+18,11-11-2023,11487877,Laura,"El apartamento es tal cual se describe y se ve en las fotos, para una estancia de tres días como la nuestra fue perfecto. El baño está limpio, algo importante. El suelo a diferencia de la mayoría de alojamientos de UK era tarima, no moqueta, por lo cual el apartamento estaba muy limpio comparado con otros. <br/>Boris fue muy agradable a nuestra llegada, respondió cuando lo necesitamos, al momento.<br/>La zona no es en el centro de Londres pero está muy bien comunicada, a treinta minutos con cuatro líneas diferentes de metro, por lo que se hace fácil moverse a cualquier sitio. Por allí hay diferentes bares, restaurantes y tiendas. Escogimos este apartamento porque calidad/precio era genial.<br/>Muy recomendable para estancias de 3-4 días, sin duda."
63948,544273,19-09-2011,427373,Rob,"We have stayed in the Hammersmith area several times before but this was our best experience - spotless, convenient and very comfortable - we wil be back!!  Rob and Jan - Adelaide, Australia "
63948,9796070,11-01-2014,513963,Leonie,This is my second stay at Aviva and it is still my opinion that it is a great place to stay. The location is fantastic with its access to to 4 rail lines all within a 5 minute walk. I never felt unsafe walking the streets late at night from the tube/rail station. It has very good access to Heathrow.
63948,21479104,18-10-2014,21868394,Ruth,"Boris was very friendly and welcoming and more than happy to help out especially when we were lost whilst trying to find the property, waiting outside to make sure we didn't miss it! Was helpful when we were enquiring about directions.<br/>Room was lovely with everything we needed for our stay. Better than expected. Would definitely return in future.<br/>Neighbourhood was lovely, very close to hammersmith apollo where we were visiting, close to tube stations with lots of restaurants and pubs near by."
63948,72239703,01-05-2016,65790203,Kishan,"If I'm honest, I was sceptical about using this kind of service but I've got to say I had such a good experience with Boris that I would use it again, just because of him.  He was very polite and informative  and really put my mind at ease. The flat was lovely and we'll maintained. I will certainly be booking with him again in the future. "
63948,77767769,03-06-2016,7421280,Jim,"Boris was very helpful, from taking our heavy suitcase upstairs to checking flight details for us. The studio was as described,  and quite adequate for our 6-day stay. Hammersmith is very convenient for buses and tubes, pubs, restaurants and shops--all within a few minutes' walk. The only problem was the excessive traffic noise early in the morning. "
63948,78070813,05-06-2016,67704228,Deirdre,Great location. Very clean well equipped room. Exactly as described in listing. Boris fantastic host.

63948,95521775,20-08-2016,1328304,Ellie,"Boris' communications were brilliant, and he was awaiting me at the property when I arrived. He helped me carry my heavy case up the stairs and gave me all the information I'd need for my stay.<br/><br/>Room was very clean and neat, and bathroom was too. Shower was amazing and bed was really comfortable.<br/><br/>5 minute walk from Hammersmith tube station, and there's a lovely pub at the end of the road. Also only 10 mins from Shepherds Bush."
63948,97199989,26-08-2016,23234098,Emily,"Great space in a great neighbour close to pubs, restaurant, shopping, public transport and good coffee! The studio we stayed in was on the second floor up two flights of stairs. It was a very clean, well kept, self contained studio. Very secure with a swipe card for access. Boris was a very nice host, especially as we had delays and didn't get there until about 3.30am... washing machine/dryer facilities were available for a small fee and the host does it for you. Great spot to stay, highly recommended!"
63948,98533579,31-08-2016,34524168,Corrie,Had a good stay here. The location was great and apartment was very clean and well maintained. Room was a bit more cramped than we expected. I think we got one of the smaller apartments. It met our needs for our short stay though.
63948,101083118,11-09-2016,31089789,Helen,"Lovely location, the room was as described and beautifully clean and tidy.    It was a lovely surprise to find my room had been tidied when I was out on the first day.<br/><br/>Thank you for the warm welcome."
63948,101237207,12-09-2016,6017215,Teresa,We stayed at this accomodation for only 1 night. When we arrived we realised it was one of many studios in a mansion block. The room we got however was not the one pictured on the air BnB listing rather an attic room at the very top of a multiple story block. The room had a heavy slanted roof which ate into the space and made it feel quite claustrophobic. And had a very small single window. Fine for a single night but would not want to stay any longer. 
63948,105118342,30-09-2016,35708120,Jim,This was a very clean and well kept place. Exceptionally clean and tidy. I'd stay there again. The staff were very friendly and attentive and the location was quiet but still near restaurants and the tube. Great place.
63948,107644127,11-10-2016,83805388,Tony,Felt almost like an inconvenience when we arrived. Boris was quick to show us to our room but made a hasty retreat before we could really get comfortable with him. 
63948,110419156,26-10-2016,35708120,Jim,"Great place, very centrally located but very noisy and the internet was so sporadic I don't think I'd stay there again. I really need good wifi as I'm a business professional doing work along the way. "

63948,115279058,23-11-2016,88780749,Di,Very close to Hammersmith station and plenty of restaurants and cafes within walkable distance.<br/>Host was professional and helpful. Check in was simple and quick which was always appreciated after a long day.<br/>Room is good size for one and packed with everything you need for a couple of nights stay even a mini kitchen. bathroom is not huge but spotless. Very happy with my room. Would consider to stay again in the future.<br/>
63948,117314909,06-12-2016,39360200,Mark,2nd time of staying and will definitely book again. Perfect place close to the underground and a warm and welcoming room. 
63948,122702085,25-12-2016,75543888,James,My girlfriend and I stayed in Boris' apartment before Christmas and had a great time. It is within easy walking distance to the tube which has quick links through to central London and the apartment was exactly as described. Would definitely recommend it!
63948,140490958,30-03-2017,95098301,Angela,"A wonderfully quiet room, well proportioned and very clean. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."

63948,718269702,26-12-2020,374407632,Andres,"A great and confortable place to stay, close to shops and tube"
63948,742070481,25-03-2021,304181269,Victoria,"Enjoyed my stay! They run it similar to a hotel, so the room you get won’t necessarily be the same as the pictures shown on Airbnb. They do give you the same style room though (ex. booked a double room, get a double room). Overall, great place for a long term stay with a small kitchenette to cook meals. Great location and hosts are wonderful!"
63948,744886098,03-04-2021,97453667,Ryan,This place has everything you need. I would definitely stay here again and Borris is a great host
63948,768062913,08-06-2021,193927301,Yasser,Perfect place to stay.<br/>Very clean and all facilities available.<br/>Can’t ask for a better place. <br/>Best experience  👍
63948,768889268,11-06-2021,240009848,Rick,"Wonderful studio. Perfect location, spacious room, comfortable beds, it was very clean, the flat had everything I needed. The hosts are very friendly ."
63948,3.99733E+17,05-07-2021,135429559,Andrea,"Boris place is a very good place if you are having holidays or just working during the mandatory quarantine. The place is good enough for one or two people. My kitchenette  didn't have enough things to cook but there was not an issue as you can go downstairs and ask for the necessary things to survive. The place is very clean and you can also ask for a change of towels and fresh sheets. The only thing a bit annoying during my stay was the construction of a building just in front of my room, as you can imagine the noise is very persistent and annoying from 9 am to 4 pm which will make you feel uncomfortable if you are stuck there all day because of the mandatory quarantine (Although this is not precisely something that the owner can control)<br/>I would definitely stay again here because on the top of everything the location is perfect."
63948,4.37458E+17,26-08-2021,408543759,Niah,"This was a really good location to stay in. It is right in Hammersmith and a 5 minute walk to the local tube station.<br/>The accommodation itself i think needs updating, there are some cracks in the wall and the room was not the same as what was in the photos, it was a room with a kitchen in it, beds and a table which imagine was the designated work area. I feel that the listing is slightly misleading. The washer and tumble dryer is a separate service which you have to pay to use which was a shame as I packed lightly thinking I<br/>would wash my clothes but I need up having to buy some clothes to get me through. <br/>The blinds in my room were old and they didn't work properly so I didn't have any privacy to get changed when the lights were  on in the room and I had to sleep with the blinds up as id spent over 10 minutes trying to work them.<br/>I also had to wait on the doorstep for about 15 minutes with all my luggage as the checkin wasn't smooth and initially my messages weren't answered.<br/>I think this room can be a good base as long as you realise what you're getting which isn't absolutely reflected in the listing."
63948,4.59931E+17,26-09-2021,46707091,Jenny,Great location for exploring London.
63948,4.63544E+17,01-10-2021,72471965,Xavier,Boris' wife is very nice and friendly. The room is clean and well-located. Good deal!

63948,6.12802E+17,25-04-2022,138383508,Jarold,Everything was according to our expectations. Good location with easy access to underground lines. Great value for money.
63948,6.17905E+17,02-05-2022,245065418,Samuel,Great room in a great location close to the tube. Bed was super comfy and all was good value.
63948,6.20142E+17,05-05-2022,320346972,Brian,"The suite is comfortable and is an ideal size for two people. It’s in a very nice neighbourhood perfect for early morning or evening walks. You couldn’t ask for a better location as a home base for visiting London. A major transit hub is only a 5 minute walk, food stores and restaurants are equally close, and it is a pleasant and easy stroll to the Thames and its riverside walking path. We also appreciated that the night hours were very quiet."
63948,6.22987E+17,09-05-2022,8133845,Dominik,"Location is amazing, just a few steps away from Hammersmith station. Great area with shops, pubs...everything you need. Easy to get to central. <br/>The place was clean and perfect for 4 days stay. Boris also allowed us a late check out which was handy. Thank you Boris and all the best!"
63948,6.32449E+17,22-05-2022,58118314,Lo,"Stayed for several weeks with Boris and couldn’t have asked for a better vantage point. Room has everything a single person needs, host is lovely, and Hammersmith is an awesome headquarters for anyone working in or exploring London - not too far away from anything but not amidst the chaos of central London. I would absolutely stay here again!"
63948,6.35371E+17,26-05-2022,70838411,Cyrille,excellent location. clean and comfortable as well as quiet. TV and WiFi are working nicely. it was clean as well as a  reasonable surface for a studio.
63948,6.43991E+17,07-06-2022,320346972,Brian,"We spent 8 days in one of Boris's studio apartments during our visit to London and area. It was the second time that we were there. As stated in my previous review, the location is great, the apartment has what you need for comfortable stay, and Boris was quick to respond to requests. I would definitely return again. To note: the studio does not contain a washer but I understand from another review that there is one in the building for a fee. We did not inquire or use the service as we were fine with washing my hand."
63948,6.47592E+17,12-06-2022,15371510,Sophie,"Clean flat, very well located. <br/>Very well suited for 2/3 nights."

63948,6.57125E+17,25-06-2022,9637660,David And Becky,"We LOVED Hammersmith - such a great area. The room was tastefully appointed, but the floor as well as the bed sloped from one side to the other. There was also very little information provided in the way of checkin and checkout. But we enjoyed our stay and look forward to staying in Hammersmith again."
63948,6.86809E+17,05-08-2022,230811529,Iliana,"Boris' place was very cosy and nice. Super close to Hammersmith station which has amazing links and easy access to central London and Heathrow Airport. <br/>We stayed here for a little over a month and the apartment was well equipped with a hob, microwave, iron, hairdryer and mini fridge. <br/>Our only complain would be on cleanliness. Even though we were provided housekeeping services once a week, we did notice the apartment wasn't cleaned well. And during our last week, the cleaning lady did not come at all. I found hair from previous tenants on the floor and the bed sheets did have some old stains on them. As a suggestion it would be nice for the apartment to have some cleaning products so we can keep it tidy ourselves.<br/>Even so, very happy to recommend and come again :)"
63948,6.9988E+17,23-08-2022,352549331,Samia,"Amazing place to stay and near the airport! Boris was really helpful and nice! The area is nice and quiet, right near the underground. Lots of shops and food places nearby!"
63948,7.02686E+17,27-08-2022,267590379,Melissa,La posizione è davvero strategica. La stanza aveva tutto ciò che serve per essere indipendente durante il soggiorno. La comunicazione è stata veloce e puntuale. Inoltre hanno tenuto le nostre valigie dopo l’orario previsto per il check out. Ci tornerei la prossima volta.

63948,7.17247E+17,16-09-2022,12738527,Jenny,"Boligen ligger bestemt centralt og er meget nem at komme til og fra med tuben. Der er rent og nydeligt. Dejligt badeværelse. Værelse hvor i køkkenet også er, er lidt lille og ligger op af en del trapper op til 2. sal dette fremgår ikke på stedets Airbnb side."
63948,7.2523E+17,27-09-2022,205758710,Shmuel,Enjoyed my stay a lot. <br/>Just one thing to note:  you'll need to climb stairs without a lift in order to get to your room. For me it was not a big issue but it worth noting.
63948,7.25869E+17,28-09-2022,288178343,Angela,Was a lovely room bed really comfortable with everything we needed for a nights stay . Communication was great and it is a very good location ..would definitely stay here again

63948,7.44094E+17,23-10-2022,245962261,Victoria,"It’s a house with a few different studios, and the one we stayed was exactly as advertised, small but had all the ammenities we needed, great clean bathroom and a kitchen with a few supplies. Just be aware that you’ll  need to carry your bags over one or two flights of stairs, but that wasn’t a big hassle since we only had to do it twice.<br/>The host was super available to us when we had any needs or doubts during our stay, and he kindly let us leave the bags in the house after checkout since our flight was later in the day.<br/>The location is wonderful, really close to Hammersmith station which gives you access to many parts of Central London in 20-30 min and is relatively close to Heathrow (about 40 min tube ride via Picadilly line)<br/>Definetely would stay here again!"
63948,7.47611E+17,28-10-2022,348669313,Delphine,"I had an amazing stay! The apartment is very well located in Hammersmith near many good restaurants, bars and shops. Boris was really kind at my arrival at his reception, the room was clean, well equipped with everything I could need to be fully autonomous.

63948,7.57074E+17,10-11-2022,458119443,Camila,"A localização é ótima, fácil de chegar através de metrô nos principais pontos turísticos e aeroporto de Heathrow. Bairro com preços de comida e bebida bem mais acessíveis do que no centro. A família que cuida dos studios é muito receptiva e atenciosa. Quarto limpo e contém o necessário para se passar alguns dias com tranquilidade. Se voltar a Londres algum dia irei me hospedar novamente nesse local."
63948,7.57849E+17,11-11-2022,63589277,Feera,Reasonable option for a studio in zone 2 for the price bracket. We didn't use the kitchen except for the kettle. The room was clean. The lady who checked us in was very nice.
63948,7.62949E+17,18-11-2022,93260744,Hugo,"Point positif :<br/>Studio très bien situé , proche de l’arrêt de métro Hammersmith permettant un accès rapide au centre de Londres. Prix raisonnable pour une location dans Londres.<br/>Boris a répondu rapidement à nos messages pour nous aiguiller.<br/>Point négatif :<br/>Humidité présente dans le studio, rendant impossible de faire sécher les serviettes, moisissures dans la salle de bain, sur les murs et dans l’armoire de la chambre. Aération du studio compliquée, avec une constante odeur de renfermée due aux raisons mentionnés au dessus.<br/>Matelas à changer, assez cheap.<br/>Mauvaise isolation, murs trop fins, bruits des autres studios. Courage pour ne pas avoir des voisins bruyants.<br/>Mauvaise accueil au AirBnb. La jeune fille qui nous accueilli n’a pas du tout été agréable. Nous avons également recroisé cette jeune fille durant notre séjour et nous n’avons même pas eu un bonjour.  Cependant la personne du check out était très agréable et souriante.<br/>Pour finir, note tres moyenne.Pratique et prix réduits."

Había fácil acceso a la estación Hammersmith del Underground con múltiples líneas y combinaciones posibles para llegar a todo Londres y alrededores. Boris te da ese espacio de privacidad necesario para poder entrar y salir en el momento que desees. Lo único negativo fue que el espacio era chico, costaba moverse dentro del studio. También, que es un lugar para gente joven o sin limitaciones en su movilidad, ya que las habitaciones están en el 1° y 2° piso y se sube por una escalera muy chica, no hay ascensor."
63948,8.28852E+17,17-02-2023,10152248,Sam,Really enjoyed the stay and would book again
63948,8.36825E+17,28-02-2023,165374412,Lizzy,Room as described and I thought was great value for money. Great location - very close to the tube station to get out and about. Some fixtures were loose/needed some repair e.g bathroom door didn't completely close properly which was fine for me on my own and something I wasn't too fussed about. Good amenities with the kitchenette. Personally didn't use much but was great to have the option. The room was clean and what I needed.  Also to advise which others have said it's stairs no lift to be mindful if you have heavy bags. Boris communicated promptly and his wife checked me in who was very lovely and professional! Also had my room cleaned daily. Would definitely consider staying again in the future - thank you!
63948,8.46259E+17,13-03-2023,388132978,Matthew,Very nice place close to the station and easy to get to everything.

63948,9.45561E+17,28-07-2023,302544809,Tayta,"Foram 22 dias maravilhosos que passamos no espaço do Boris e da Dusica (sua esposa). O bairro é completo e em 5 minutos estávamos na estação com acesso as Linhas Piccadilly e District Line. Espaço aconchegante, limpo, cama confortável e vizinhança silenciosa. Nada poderia ter sido melhor. Super recomendo!"
63948,9.46924E+17,30-07-2023,294344453,Jana,"A nice calm place 5 minutes from underground, great for trips, in the evening I can really reccomend a walk to Hammersmith bridge and along the river with old pubs."

63948,9.63595E+17,22-08-2023,421973292,Christopher,"We felt right at home. Boris and his wife were very friendly. The room was neat and clean  - a little small but comfortable. We could have done with a small place to dry a few clothes like a rope in the bathroom. The place is very central - a few minutes walk to 2 train stations and bus stations, shops  and food places. The cleaning lady too was very helpful. We would highly recommend this place for comfort and location."
63948,9.64355E+17,23-08-2023,14081379,Lauren,Friendly welcome and a great location.
63948,9.70143E+17,31-08-2023,77580443,Lisa,Boris was super friendly.  And I felt safe in the space.  The neighborhood was wonderful and close to the tube station. There was a wonderful pub just down the road also.  All the great tourists things are just a quick subway ride away and so is the airport.<br/>The apartment is very small.  The table was not large enough to set up a laptop.  Also the washer and dryer are not in the room and there is a fee to use the service.  There was air conditioning available which was welcome after being without in the other Airbnbs I booked in Europe.
63948,9.78812E+17,12-09-2023,169823902,Rebekah,"We had a great stay, everything exceeded expectations and it was a lovely homey environment. Close to amenities and the train in particular. Would definitely stay here again!"

Hammersmith contains some great restaurants and hotels/bars which we explored.<br/>Boris’ wife was very helpful and responsive in answering any queries we had<br/>Highly recommend this place for couples travelling to London
63948,9.97697E+17,08-10-2023,190048613,Claire,"We stayed for one night as a base as running the Royal Parks half marathon the Sunday Am.<br/>Was a good clean space in a great location for the Hammersmith tube and close to lots of pubs, restaurants , shops etc.<br/>Only points to mention are that the toilet door did not fully close. Not end of world as 2 good friends sharing but would have liked a bit more privacy when going to the loo! Another pillow would have been great for comfort as only 1 for each person. <br/>Would recommend for a base to sleep, was clean and greeted on arrival by the partner of Boris who was lovely and friendly."
63948,1.00058E+18,12-10-2023,32455501,Andrew,"We had a wonderful stay in Hammersmith at this facility.  It is really well located, close to a bunch of eating options - pubs, restaurants etc and very close to Hammersmith station with lots of public transport options.

63948,1.00498E+18,18-10-2023,146883007,Silvia & Agustin,"We had a long day coming from Seville, our flight had a delay and when we arrived to London, the line we suppose to take, was closed, but all this fade away when Boris welcome us with his kind smile and believe me, in that moment we needed that.<br/>The apartment is perfect, you have everything you need and is very comfortable, we enjoyed the moments we stay in.<br/>But Boris and her wife must get all the credit, because anything we need, they where there for us with that smile we never forget, thank you guys for that.😊"
63948,1.01002E+18,25-10-2023,494559243,Gustavo,"Acomodação sensacional! Ótimo custo benefício. Bairro super tranquilo, mas com bastante opção de comércio. Fica a apenas 5 minutos da estação Hammersmith, abastecida por 4 linhas do metrô, então muito fácil e rápido de ir para qualquer lugar de Londres. O quarto era espaçoso, limpo, com uma pequena cozinha que foi bastante útil. Boris foi um excelente anfitrião, sempre respondendo rapidamente e nos ajudando quando precisávamos de algo. Super recomendo o local!"
63948,1.01439E+18,31-10-2023,4331211,Katie,"Affordable, quiet, safe, no-frills accommodation in a western suburb of London. Easy access to the Tube. Less that 30 mins to Heathrow or Central London. Also easy to take public transport from here to Gatwick, although it’s a bit far. Convenient base for us to explore Stonehenge and The Cotswolds by car.  Host was very responsive regarding check-in, despite the fact that our plans changed three times."

Overall, they didn't expeience a single problem and the rooms were very economical and the value for money was excellent"
66772,185787,21-02-2011,160135,Christian,"As ever, a comfortable stay. Boris could not be a more a helpful or friendly host.<br/><br/>The location is minutes away from three different tube lines and just behind a busy shopping street - a great spot."
66772,197481,12-03-2011,428093,Priscilla,"Very nice small but clean room wih own kitchen. Bathroom is shared with one other room but at every time very clean. All you need is in the room (iron, hair dryer, coffee ...) Nice location and Boris (who lives downstairs in the building) is very helpful. A good place if your looking to stay a couple of days in London!"
66772,241638,26-04-2011,517095,Catia,"An amazing place to stay!<br/>I’ve stayed in Boris’ house during two weeks and it was a wonderful stay!They are friendly and the location is perfect (in a beautiful place and with several different underground lines to the center of the city).<br/>I definitely recommend!!<br/>"
66772,1303526,19-05-2012,1594113,Kate,"I checked out for a night and back in the next day, I actually stayed in studio one rather than 3 this time, this is because Boris said he knew I preferred that room :)"
66772,3789368,15-03-2013,4637758,Emma,"We were in London for the night to see a band at the Hammersmith Apollo and chose Aviva studios because it was just around the corner from the Apollo. The studio was clean and had everything we needed for our short stay, including free wi-fi. We'd definitely use again. "

Room is clean and comfortable, the shared bathroom is just beside the room and it is very clean. We stayed at the highest level. Boris is very helpful - helped us with our luggage and allowed us to leave our luggage at the reception after checking out. Recommended!"
66772,26123250,03-02-2015,15747770,Adam,"Probably my best airbnb stay so far (out of 4 times). A professional set-up, rather than someone just making a bit of money on the side. More like a hotel / serviced apartment experience.  Boris was very helpful, even carrying my (very heavy) suitacse all the way up the stairs!  Everything perfect, apart from it being cold at first, as the heating had been turned off. This was quickly rectifiied though, so no problem."
66772,28159653,19-03-2015,25037583,Joan,"Tanto Boris como su mujer han sido amables y correctos en cuanto a trato. La casa esta muy bien. Me alojé en el apart 3 y aparte de que es un poco compacto es suficiente de espacio. La ducha y baño bien. <br/><br/>La tostadora no funcionaba y el aparato hervidor soltaba oxido. Y las sábabas estaban un poco desgastadas. Estas son las unicas pegas. El resto muy positivo.<br/><br/>Sitio a 20 min del centro con el Tube ( metro). Si vuelvo probablemente repetiré. <br/><br/>4 from 5 stars"

66772,99498545,05-09-2016,25040898,Colin,"On arrival I was impressed by the neat and tidy courtyard and building. A good start. I was greeted and made welcome.  The apartment was super-clean, had well-finished modern decor, and had everything needed (microwave, fridge, hot plates, kitchen sink, table, iron & ironing board), to cover all requirements.  I was very impressed by the cleanliness and daily upkeep of the apartment.  I often saw the cleaners who always asked if everything was good and if there was anything needed. The entrance and apartment door had a convenient electronic card lock. There was a safe in the room, plenty of hanging and shelf space for clothes, wifi and TV etc, and a very comfortable bed.  There are two windows giving adequate cross ventilation in addition to an A/C unit and heater.  The size of the apartment is compact but realistic for inner London (and the price).  I was a solo traveller and had no problems.  The bathroom is small but fully functional.  The shower unit is curved which works well in the room size but large persons may find the shower cramped.  The apartment is at the top of the building (2+ flights of stairs) which I found no problem even with some heavy luggage.  The apartment was quiet - even though there was a construction site across the street (which did not commence work until 8AM).<br/><br/>The address is near stations (1-2 blocks) for several tube lines as well as bus routes.  Very easy transport.  There are supermarkets (Sainburys, Tesco etc) and many cafes, pubs and restaurants nearby.<br/><br/>Overall I had an excellent stay and recommend Boris' apartments as a great and convenient place to stay in London."

66772,426559972,21-03-2019,70440027,David,A very few minutes walk from the tube and near so many amenities.  For the price - very good value.
66772,445887009,30-04-2019,91105474,Martin,"The studio is located in a big private house of the host. There are 3 levels with about 9 studios. It‘s a quiet neighbourhood but shops, restaurants and the underground are only a short walk away (at max. 5 minutes). <br/>The studio itself wasn‘t that big but very cozy and was equiped with everything you need - even a Little kitchen, microwave etc. Everything was super clean. There was a room Service that cleaned the studio every day!<br/>If you take the underground you‘ll need around 20 minutes to the most popular sightseeing spots. <br/>We really loved everything and Wohls highly recommend staying there if you are looking for an affordable place to stay."

66772,534890035,23-09-2019,72109993,Sue,This apartment/room wth en-suite & kitchenette was all you could want on a visit to London.Close to Hammersmith tube &  bus station.

66772,544151756,09-10-2019,9963877,John,Very handy for Hammersmith Tube and bus station being only about a 5 minute walk. Efficient reception and check in. Room clean and as expected from the photographs. A good place to stay in this price bracket if you want to be based in west London. Stairs are steep but no issue for us (In our 60s!) but might be for some people. You can leave your bags on checkout to collect later if you want.
66772,586036213,01-01-2020,120487334,Madelaine,"Gute Lage, man kommt schnell und einfach vom Flughafen London Heathrow zur Unterkunft und von dieser in die Innenstadt. Das Zimmer war zwar klein, aber alles Notwendige war vorhanden, sogar eine kleine Küche. Ein-und Auschecken war problemlos."

66772,615537140,08-03-2020,299697420,Maria Adeline,"This AirBnB is perfect! It is in close proximity to 2 underground stations with 4 tube lines that get you to wherever you need in London. There are also bus stations really close. There are shopping centers nearby with pharmacies, supermarkets and clothing stores and pretty good restaurants too. Towels were changed daily. You have a small kitchenette in your room with a fridge, sink, microwave, hot plate, toaster and more. Boris and his wife are really helpful and nice. You can contact them before arriving if you like, but if not, you can just walk up to the residence because they have a reception and someone is usually there to help you. If and when we return to London we will most definetly book a room here once again."
66772,620673976,23-03-2020,339855483,Alan,"Boris is a fantastic host supported in the UK by his Wife when he must be absent, in the home Boris was born in. They are a lovely and sensitive couple who have a very clean and very well appointed property, which for my son, was a great pleasure to stay in. Hammersmith Undergorund is moments away and you can get anywhere, the Lyric Theatre is almost across the road.  I will book the room again in a heartbeat and cant wait to stay there again."

The place is located very close to Hammersmith station and the area is lovely. The place is not big but it has everything you need, a comfy bed, renovated rooms and great hospitality. My parents arrived very early in the morning and manage to find the room ready and they could store their luggages there during the day after checking out. Very helpful!"

66772,5.41162E+17,16-01-2022,2625015,Susan,"This comes under the 'too good to be true' heading, with the exception that it is all accurate and incredible value!<br/>This is a perfect central location with everything you need for a self-contained stay in a warm friendly small 'hotel' environment<br/>It's much better to spend money staying here ( for example) than exactly the same money on a train ticket from about 50 miles away, and if you're coming from further away you are really quids in!<br/>I was attending a conference in Hammersmith and my fellow delegates could not believe the value I got for the very low price for central London actually challenged me to show them my booking, the photographs of the accommodation, and the price I paid!!<br/>Excellent value for money that over-delivers, I will be staying with Boris in the future. Thank you very much"
66772,5.65062E+17,18-02-2022,48100629,Tiago,The room is small but just enough for a turist. Was very clean and the communication between me and Boris was very good. Boris os very thoughtful and an amazing host.

It is indeed cosy but comfortable and had everything I needed for a short stay. Shower can be a little cramped especially for bigger people. Great location and really close to the tube and buses for getting around. Note that you do need to walk up three narrow flights of stairs so better travel light!"

Good value for money and close to Hammersmith Tube Station with free parking available at weekends - Boris was great, kept in touch with us and was there via message if we needed. Our room was on the top floor and was hot (we stayed during the heatwave) We didn't realize that Aircon was £3 extra per day, although Boris allowed us to add this on in the evening. Other than this the room was good and had everything needed facilities-wise - en suite, microwave, iron, hairdryer etc."

66772,7.42568E+17,21-10-2022,464491463,Mariko,初めてのairbnb利用です。<br/>予約を取る時から、Borisさんはとても親切に対応してくださいました。<br/>チェックインアウトがとてもスムーズです。<br/>部屋は2F(日本式で3階)で、細い階段を登ります。荷物が重いので少々手こずりましたが、内装が素敵でこれからの滞在が楽しみになります。<br/>お部屋はとても清潔で、定期的に部屋の掃除とタオル交換をしてくださいます。<br/>2口IHのキッチンには鍋やフライパンなどの調理器具や食器、カトラリーも揃っており自炊可能です。電子レンジと電気ケトル、ポップアップトースターもありました。時々朝食を自炊して楽しみました。<br/>コンセントの一つが多国サイズ対応だったので、日本の変圧器いらずのヘアアイロンを直差しで使えたのは嬉しかったです。<br/>1週間目に洗濯を頼んだら乾燥まで全てやってくれ、翌日には受け取れました。とても助かりました。洗濯代金は受け取りの時に支払いました。<br/>立地も素晴らしいです。ハマースミス駅から歩いて5分以内なので、バスや電車の移動に便利です。すぐ近くにサンタンダー自転車のポートもありますよ。<br/>スーパーマーケットも近いし、美味しいご飯屋さんもたくさんあります。<br/>個人的には治安は良い方だと感じました。フラットの近くは夜も静かでよく寝られます。<br/>2週間の予定が親の訃報により3日短くなり、急に帰らなければならなくなった時、ボリスさんはとても親切丁寧でした。本当に心から感謝しています。<br/>もう一度行けるなら、また利用したいです。素晴らしいオーナー、素晴らしいフラットです。
66772,7.4762E+17,28-10-2022,236532379,Susany,"It was an excellent experience stay @ Boris place. The room is quite small but fits two perfectly for 5-6 days trip. It's clean, cosy and the bed is great. The building is pretty close to all amenities in Hammersmith, even shopping centres, pubs, delis,  coffee shop and especially train station. Boris is a very friendly and polite guy who has helped us keeping our luggage before the flat was available! Highly recommend Boris apartments!"
66772,7.52031E+17,03-11-2022,106590823,Armelle,Logement très propre. Merci pour tout.
66772,7.57143E+17,10-11-2022,29212460,Pamela,"wonderful location, next to the tube, quiet area near all services"
66772,7.79577E+17,11-12-2022,36459369,Joseph,"The hotel room was extremely small. I am a normal sized person, and I struggled to even turn around in the shower without accidentally turning the water on hot (which was way too hot).<br/>The temperature in the room couldn't be regulated unless you opened a window, and it was often way too warm in the room. I'm convinced I got sick from having to keep the window open.<br/>The bed was terribly uncomfortable. The mattress seemed old, and you could feel every spring.<br/>The bathroom 'door' offered no privacy.<br/>My girlfriend and I were here for 9 nights, so we had two large bags. There was nowhere to put them, and they were constantly in the way. Like I said, the room was SMALL.<br/>I want to say - I know I'm an American, and the sizes of things in America are larger than they are in the UK, but I lived in London for 4 years, so I have realistic expectations of how big things should be. This room was absurdly small. I almost felt like I was in a Mr. Bean skit."
66772,7.95545E+17,02-01-2023,20652536,Rennan,"The space looks exactly like the pictures. The place was tidy and clean. Hammersmith is a quiet, calm and yet full of life part of London. There is stores, pubs, markets and station is quiet near, connecting visitors to the important Piccadily Line. Boris and his partner were really good, smooth and clear with us. I highly reccomend it! Thanks, Boris! ☺️"
66772,8.07886E+17,19-01-2023,488636334,Anton,I had a good night's sleep. A nice self-contained space.
66772,8.15125E+17,29-01-2023,140384633,Arundhati,"Summary: Great value, cosy and pristine, well connected.<br/>What we loved: The place was easy to find, 3 minutes from the Hammersmith tube station. Check in was smooth. <br/>All facilities promised were provided. The listing mentioned cooking essentials like oil and salt and pepper would be available, when we asked for them it was immediately provided.<br/>The room was equipped with everything we wanted, and looked just like the pictures. Everything was spotless! The cleaning lady came on the 4th day of our day, she did a fantastic job. Boris and his wife are professional and amiable.<br/>The neighbourhood is lovely, Central London easily accessible through the Tube. Shops near by.<br/>What could be an issue: the room is accessible through a narrow staircase of three flights. Can be a challenge for some. The shower space is cramped. At least one lamp in the room should have more power, the lighting was dim.<br/>Overall I’d highly recommend. The key point for me was the proximity to Central London."
66772,8.25255E+17,12-02-2023,398475192,Anna,"Le logement était bien situé, très près de la gare. <br/>La literie était bonne, la salle de bain était spacieuse. <br/>La cuisine était fonctionnelle, il manquait peut être un peu de vaisselle mais ce qu’il y avait était suffisant. <br/>Les hôtes étaient très réactifs lorsque nous avions une question/ recommandations etc…<br/>Je recommande cet endroit !"

Hammersmith is just wonderful, just 5 mins from the Thames. There are shops and super markets, many restaurants and pubs! You have 4 tube lines just 5 mins walk from the accomodation. <br/>Last but not least, the price is reasonable and makes Boris place affordable for a long stay or if you want to book more than two night, quite rare in London!!! <br/>Recommended"
66772,8.39758E+17,04-03-2023,425363317,Patricia,Estudio pequeño pero acogedor. Tienes todo lo que necesitas para poder pasar varios días. Todo muy limpio y bonito. La ubicación es perfecta ya que está la estación de metro y de bus a tres minutos. Lo único que no estoy a favor es en la comodidad del colchón. Todo lo demás muy correcto.
66772,8.40125E+17,04-03-2023,104986362,Christopher,Boris didn’t reply to any messages sent in the lead up to our booking then emailed late the night before to cancel the booking and gave no help in rebooking somewhere else.

Plenty of on street parking in the evenings / weekends. Tube 25 mins direct into the city centre. Pubs, restaurants and shops on the doorstep pretty much! The room was clean and very quiet - lots of steps to our room on the top floor of the townhouse but I’m sure if accessibility is an issue another room could be booked. Huge shower, good basics in the kitchen and very comfortable bed. Would absolutely stay again and recommend to friends."

Muy bien comunicada, trasporte publico a la zona centro solo a 5 minutos.<br/>Algo que mejoraría de la habitación sería el colchón que,  aun que esta bien para 2 adultos, se notan un poco los muelles. Por lo general estamos bastante satisfechos. Volvería a repetir.  😊😊"

The host and his wife were really great with communication and being available to us.<br/>The only note would be that we felt our room was not really cleaned while we were there as the garbage was not taken out and we had to ask ourselves for towels instead of putting them in the shower like it was indicated. There was also a problem with the shower drain.<br/>Nonetheless, I would recommend this accommodation and stay there again!"

Although we knew that the room was at the top of the house when we booked we didn't appreciate how steep the steps were and if we booked again would book one of the rooms lower down. There were a couple of maintenance issues, but nothing major. We would certainly recommend this accommodation for anyone who is looking to visit London."

67934,781329,12-12-2011,1317101,Raj,"Dee is such a friendly, cheerful person. i enjoyed having chats with her.  she let me use her kitchen, having made a personal request beforehand. once i got onto Dee's street and in her house i felt glad after a long day. it's warm, cosy, clean and it felt like home. she made me feel very comfortable and i felt free to go down to watch t.v or use kitchen at anytime. the bedroom was very bright and warm. and clean. wifi worked great! only thing for me was power of shower was weak but do-able. the distance is about 25-30 minutes on tube. its a completely different vibe from the city. more local shops. but its the northern line and i didnt have to make any changes. even if you need oxford street, or british museum u can just get off at tottenham court rd tube in the city which is 25-30mins without changing. i would stay here again. her house is actually one of my best experiences overall.

67934,2287942,14-09-2012,3415540,Marco,"It has been a great abroad experience thanks to Laura and her family. I was in a very nice comfortable and clean room, they were really hospitable people with me. She was like a mum in England, she taught me how to properly speak in english, she told me how to properly do what I should have done during my holiday.<br/>The house is clean, it's close to burnt oak underground station and the Tesco market, so it's in a perfect position to take the bus or the underground to go around London.<br/>My experience was fantastic. Thank you Laura!"

The place itself is a little far out of the city, taking approximately 35-40 minutes on the tube, but this is a great place on a small budget."
67934,35227758,16-06-2015,33014443,Sonja,"Laura was a fantastic host who made me feel very welcome. The room was comfortable and clean, so was the bathroom. <br/><br/>The house is located very close to Burnt Oak station which takes you into central London in about 25 minutes which is handy.<br/><br/>Laura and the rest of her family were easy to communicate with and my overall experience with renting this room was great and I would highly recommend it!<br/>"

67934,243512470,16-03-2018,137414042,Jon,Very nice lady and was really welcoming. I had my own key to come and go as i please. It was very close to my training for the week. Only 15 mins. Local high street less than 5 mins walk. Tube and buses less than 5 mibs away. Brilliant value
67934,351604478,23-11-2018,220007472,Joe,clearn and close to tube station. I could have bought some staff like food at small store and big market nearby house. Meal shop also cheap more than central area.

67934,542306724,06-10-2019,10109600,Sergio,"Really nice family and place, I spent an entire week there and was always quite, clean and confortable. Laura is, as everybody has already mentioned, a really good host, always with a smile and ready to help. It is just a little bit far away from central London, but you can get there easily with the Northern Line and I suppose the more than reasonable price per night accounts also for that. In short, do not hesitate to choose it as airbnb!"
67934,575092846,09-12-2019,286167424,Abu,"The room is clean but the heater will make you hot even it’s on the first level and you can’t close it. The room is far from the bathroom. The location is cool and close to the tube and surrounded by everything you need. Laura and her husband are really cool but Laura sometimes will be over strict. Otherwise, she was a good host."

69198,1603031,01-07-2012,2444050,Linda,"I received a warm welcome from from Alda and her partner Luc following a long direct fight from NZ, Reaching Alda'a flat was alot quicker than expected being on the Picadilly Line direct to/from Heathrow - a major advantage when travelling through London., Also amazingly convenient for Kings Cross and St Pancrass Stations. Loved the quiet parkland feel of this culturally diverse area - and found the parks the perfect location for energising morning walk and a few yoga stretches. Flat very clean, loo and bathroom imaculate, and nice access to back garden . Alda was quick to respond to my booking enquiry and very helpful with directions. The hospitality was typically Italian, warm and pleasant, and the coffee was great. Thank you for a nice stay. Linda"

So I had Luca and he was very hospitable, welcomed me with a dinner and said bye with a big breakfast which was very nice. The room is as on the picture, quite spacious, sunny in the morning and overall tidy. Only thing to remember is that the guys are quite strict on the reservation policy; I had to come a few days earlier and leave earlier too which Alda did not agree to even out: I had to pay the daily fee for the beginning and did not get it back at the end. But after all this is just the official policy kept rigorously. Overall recommended."

Alda gave me good tips about the area. <br/>Alda is a very strict host and sometimes I could feel uncomfortable at times.<br/>The room is big and beautiful but is much colder than the rest of the house. I wasn't allowed to control the heater so at times I was quite cold.
69198,4.62837E+17,30-09-2021,31963099,César,"The overall experience with Alda was good.  <br/>Positive: Alda and his partner Luca were friendly hosts, and easy to talk to. I stayed two weeks and I did not have any problem. The location was also good, be mindful you are going to be up up up north London. It is close to the underground Turnpike Lane (Picadilly line to central in 30 minutes) and a beautiful park next to call Downhills Park. Regarding the house, it is okay, very clean, the room is huge and the only downside is the bed is single, a bit small for me. <br/>Negative: The room did not have a wardrobe, hence, I stay two weeks with my belongings in the luggage. The house has four lockers and Alda is always making sure everything is close properly and the house is in good condition (makes sense as she is the owner of the place). But bear in mind, she will look at it.<br/>Generally: If you need to be in north north north London, then, this is a fair place."

Hackney Village is a five minute walk, which has a couple cool pubs, good food, and essentials shops. Just beyond is Victoria Park, which is huge and rad and has a lovely cafe where I ate salmon bagels  literally every day. I walked to and fro from parties and gigs in east London. It was idyllic. Clearly, would recommend. Michael is super easy to deal with, super present, and the neighbors are all very chill too."

The neighborhood is very beautiful with lots of good restaurants, coffee shops, and stores very close by. We really enjoyed walking through Victoria Park and having breakfast at the Pavilion.  The place is also located close to bus stops making it easy to get around London. The apartment had everything we needed. The bed was super comfortable and the rooftop patio was also very nice.  Michael is a great host! Very communicative and helpful."

We mostly kept to ourselves once we were in for the night, but Matthew was often there with a greeting and kind word when we went out or came in.  The location is conveniently close to Tube and bus lines.  We would stay here again and may just do so the next time we travel to London.  Thanks for everything!"

72913,338539,27-06-2011,678625,Tim,"The room in Mathew's was clean and lovely with a view of a harem below us. The room had a wardrobe and a chest of drawers for our clothes and a  charming photograph on the wall. He was solicitous but not hovering.<br/>The wireless intenet connection was not dependable but when there was a problem he very kindly allowed my wife to use his laptop to access the web. "
72913,347263,02-07-2011,478162,Michael,"My wife and I stayed at Matthew's place at the beginning of July. It was our first time using airbnb and our first time in London. We weren't quite sure what to expect. The room was very tidy and the bed was comfortable. The location was also nice as it was very close to the tube, but just off of the beaten path. There were plenty of choices for food within walking distance and a laundry mat at the end of the block. Matthew was an excellent host and he was very hospitable. We felt right at home. We very much enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.  "
72913,356493,06-07-2011,595555,Debbie,"Matthew was a great host, easily sharing his knowledge of the neighborhood and London.  We applied his wisdom and had a fantastic 4 days.  The neighborhood pubs he recommended were excellent (and we're food snobs from California).  The room was a nice, bright, private room with a small shower and sink/toilet for our own use, nice duvet and sheets, and a pleasant view of the back garden below. Matthew gave us keys so we could come and go as we pleased, but we were always greeted with a hello and his taking time to listen to our adventures.  Just the right amount of interaction for us.  We would definitely stay with Matthew again.  The room was right on the Northern line with super easy connection to the Bakerloo and Central/District lines, just a minute walk from the Oval station, so we got around easily and quickly on our Zone 1,2 daily passes.  <br/>"

72913,383661,19-07-2011,668411,Marcia,"This double en suite in the Oval area of London is a lovely, quiet place to stay. The accommodations are clean and beautiful, with windows overlooking gardens. The location -- in a residential neighborhood of tree-lined streets -- is a very short walk from the Oval underground station, where several bus routes also make stops. There are also a number of restaurants and coffee shops in the area. Matthew provided a map with restaurant recommendations.<br/><br/>Matthew is a friendly, welcoming host -- I wish I had been able to have more conversations with him during my stay, but our paths didn't cross after the first day. I highly recommend choosing this as a place to stay and hope to stay there again myself.<br/><br/>"

The combination of very comfy bed, spacious room (en suite), high speed internet connection and 3 minute walk to the tube make this place an absolute gem.<br/><br/>Staying with Matthew was like visting a friend, and not simply loding overnight with a stranger. I would not hesitate to book again!<br/>"
72913,556833,22-09-2011,184396,Nicole,"Matthew was a lovely host  who I enjoyed a chat with in our brief times meeting up. he was quick and easy to communicate with giving me good tips on how to get to his house by train from Gatwick. <br/>The room which is located on the first level of the house was impeccably clean with a comfortable, large queen bed, a garden view, it's own ensuite and wifi. It also had lovely Danish furniture with plenty of room to stow your belongings and thoughtfully provided with an iron and ironing board as well.<br/>Getting around was easy as the house is a 3 min walk from Oval tube station on the Northern line and an 8 min walk from Vauxhall station which connects with the tube and also the southern rail system. There is a small convenience shop open near the Oval tube for supplies and also a great pub around the corner too.<br/><br/>"

The house is very nice and easy to find from the Oval Tube Station, not even a 5 min walk.<br/>Matthew was very welcoming and explained a a little about the area and where to eat and drink...I can recommend Henris, they do a full English breakfast there, and the Fentimans Arms. Both very near and good!<br/>I didn't see much of him at the weekend, but that was also due to the fact that I was out most of the time! He was also very nice about my chekc out time, I could leave whenever I wanted!<br/><br/>The room is nice and spacious, tiny toilet and little shower...but all very clean and adequate!<br/><br/>I also left a beer in the Drinks fridge, yes there is a fridge for drinks only!<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend staying with Matthew if you are not to keen to be in a touristy area...Lambeth is quite laid back and a little off the trodden trail, but close enough to reach anything central within 20 min.<br/><br/><br/><br/>"
72913,748913,28-11-2011,1152288,Gerry,"Matthew is a terrific host who is helpful, respectful and easy going.  The en-suite bedroom is bright, clean and neat, with very easy access to two underground stations (zone 1 and zone 2).  Major city attractions, such as Leicester Square, Covent Garden and Borough market, are all 4 or 5 stops away.  The neighborhood is located in a quintessential London residential area with several excellent restaurants and supermarkets nearby.  Definitely our choice to stay next time in London."

Matthew was very helpful with tips on what to do and where to go in London. He provided us with various guides and maps - both for London and Paris as we took a day trip during our stay.  <br/><br/>The location was very convenient - a 3 minute walk to Oval Tube Station as well as local buses.  It is also right by Kennington Park which we appreciated because it was a nice spot to run around in the mornings before heading out for the day.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!  Would  stay here on my next London voyage without a doubt.<br/><br/>Thanks, Matthew!<br/>"

It was a perfect place to rest after  discovering London (quiet area, comfortable bed, well working wifi, toilet and shower a bit tiny but everything very clean). Matthew is an easy going host, no problems at all. :) We definitely recommend!"

It is very well located (2 minutes from the underground) and the house is beautiful: well decorated (we fell in love with the floor) and very welcoming. We liked the good balance between the privacy of the room and its facilities and the opportunity to discuss with Matthew about London, and places to visit. <br/>The fact it is on the Northern Line (underground) makes it very central to explore London and really easy to reach from the Eurostar station. We LOVED it!<br/>"

72913,1481583,14-06-2012,1889469,Clare,"Really good stay. Very comfortable accommodation. Only minutes away from Oval Station, and no more than five-ten minutes into the Southbank, Trafalgar Square, Covent Garden. Very quiet, felt like home waking up to birdsong, but the faint rumbling of the tube reminded you that you were in London, which I liked. Couldn't fault the stay. Michael was friendly, helpful and has a lovely home. "

He even had tube's map and books about travelling in London that we could read. Although the toilet is very small, it is private (no need to go out of the room) and the rest of the room is spacious. It is also very clean and comfy.<br/>The flat is very well located, only 2 minutes from Oval station and then a few minutes to Victoria or King Cross St-Pancras stations.<br/>Excellent stay overral, I definately recommend it, as it is even better than some hotels!"
72913,1689064,12-07-2012,660545,Ahmad,"For me, personally, the host was more important than the house, but at Matthew's, I had a combination of both, a kind host and a good house.<br/><br/>Matthew is a very kind and helpful man. He made us feel absolutely home. He also saved us some good pounds by giving us helpful tips :)<br/>The house is clean and neat; It's also very close to the underground and bus stations; from there you can start your cultural walking tour, and If you're into shopping, you can take a 20 minutes bus ride to Oxford street where you'll find all the exclusive shops.<br/><br/>I would definitely stay there when I come back to London!"
72913,1768152,22-07-2012,2426725,Eliza,"This was my first airbnb experience and was glad I had Matthew as my first host. The room and house were clean and tidy, and Matthew had everything covered - the room was equipped with everything that you'd need for a comfortable stay. The location was perfect for me as I was attending a course near Bermondsey but it would also suit a more general trip to London as the Oval tube station was so close to the house. <br/>Thanks Matthew. I would definitely stay again."
72913,1858654,01-08-2012,2207205,Caroline,"We had a wonderful stay with Matthew in London. The flat is conveniently located close to the Oval tube station.

Matthew allowed us access to his kitchen and common spaces. "
72913,1911314,07-08-2012,2196929,Tony,"Traveling to London for the Olympics was enough on our minds and staying with Matthew was the easiest part. He was an excellent host with plenty of accommodations and recommendations of places to visit. We had the freedom of coming and going as needed and the room including its own attached bathroom was perfect! We would definitely stay with Matthew again as he was extremely friendly, kept a tidy place, and the location was a mere 5 minute walk to the underground. Thanks Matthew!"

72913,2529708,07-10-2012,1093474,Ruth,My friend and I stayed seven nights at Matthew's place. Matthew was a terrific host! We felt very comfortable in his beautiful house and the area (even late at night). Oval station provides perfect and fast connection to the center of London. We'd definitely recommend Matthew as host and would stay at his place again. 
72913,2669310,21-10-2012,2656051,Alexandre,"I've stayed there for 5 days, and the entire experience was positive. The owner is very reachable, the place is comfortable, clean and practical. Your room will face a lovely backyard, beautifully done. The location is great, really close to the Oval metro station, walking distance. Many buses that will take you easily to all the main tourist attractions. And take some time to discover the area! Many great restaurants nearby, african, portuguese restaurants and cafés, italian cafés, pubs, beautiful parks.  I can only endorse all the previous positive comments. Nothing shorter than perfect. You can stop looking now and just go ahead and book this place."
72913,2776692,01-11-2012,574182,Thomas,"Matthew's house is a real find- fantastically located in a nice quiet side street in a lovely part of Lambeth, a very short walk to a northern line tube station. It's very well furnished and kept, and whilst the guest room's en suite bathroom / shower are surprisingly small they are well kept and perfectly fine once you figure out the mechanics. Matthew himself was always there if we had any questions or needed anything.- efficient, kind and helpful, and very much gave us lots of space and free reign to enjoy ourselves whilst we stayed there; giving us some solid restaurant recommendations and helping us get familiar with the area quickly. I'll be recommending this place to my friends and colleagues when they next visit London."
72913,2854613,11-11-2012,2078197,Tatiana,"Matthew's room is very cosy and, though small, has everything you might need. It's really very close to the metro station, and not very far from the center of the city. Matthew himself is a  nice and polite host."

72913,3852713,21-03-2013,4497845,Ildiko,"Our first airbnb experience is Matthew""s home was very positive! <br/>He helped us to plan our journey from the airport, although the house is indeed just 3 minutes walk from Oval tube station, a lot of other bus lines and a very nice park. The room is quiet, overlooking a very nice garden. It was great that it had a private bathroom, but we felt that we had a private  kitchen and living room too, as we hardly met with Matthew. Thank you Matthew!<br/>"

72913,4198081,17-04-2013,5673239,Sara,I loved staying in Matthew's apartment. It's on a nice quiet street but it's only a quick walk to the Oval tube station (which has to be the best in all of London because there's a daily inspirational quote and classical music playing constantly). It was a great mix of being close to all the touristy places we wanted to hit and sleeping well in a London neighborhood. Matthew is an excellent host -- I highly recommend this listing!
72913,4489811,08-05-2013,541786,Cristina,"We stayed 5 nights at Matthews appartment near Oval station and had a really great time. The neighborhood is really nice, with lovely community gardens and delicious italian delis. You can use the nearby tube station or the busses to get to the city. Matthews home is clean and comfortable, the room has all you need to feel at ease. Matthew is a great host, polite and very helpful. We would absolutely stay at his place again. "
72913,4674186,20-05-2013,5012267,Silvia,"Matthew's house is really nice, as beautiful as in the pictures. The guest suite has everything you need for a couple and the kitchen is very well equipped. The neighborhood is also great: the Oval tube station (northern line) is only a few meters away (about 5 minutes walk), there is a Tesco supermarket nearby and a small market with food and drinks 24 hours. As for Matthew, he is an excellent host, who left us free to come and go at any time and kept a respectful distance, but was always available to answer our questions and requests. I strongly recommend his place and I'll try to stay there again whenever I go to London."
72913,4759147,24-05-2013,5744230,Ronak,"Matthew was a good host and the apartment is very comfortable. It is a less than 5 minute walk from the Oval station and room is very comfortable.

72913,4858916,29-05-2013,5398989,Jörn,I wanted to visit London for some days together with my teenage son. We stayed in Matthews room and visited London from there. It was easy to find and Matthew was very flexible with our arrival and our departure. The house is just a five minute walk away from the tube station oval and just some stations to leicester square. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfy. We were allowed to use the refrigerator and the kitchen. Matthew was polite and helpful so it was an easy and nice stay. Thank You!
72913,5013661,07-06-2013,6589496,Ryan,"Matthew was a pleasure to deal with through the whole process, from booking and corresponding via email, all the way to hosting and checkout.  He is a lovely person, easy to be around and respectful of privacy, and his home is as lovely in person as it is in the photos.  It is very conveniently located (under 5 minutes) to the Oval station on the Northern Line and many many busses. Rarely did it take me more than 20 minutes to get to anywhere in Zone 1.  The neighborhood is perfectly safe and has all the necessary conveniences nearby.  I wouldn't have a single hesitation staying with Matthew again, and in fact probably will the next time I travel to London!"

He gave us lots of maps and tips about London city, and was very helpful with ideas for our stay.<br/>The place was really clean and modern, and the bedroom had heaps of room.

His house is darling, and very well appointed, and the room itself is lovely with its private bathroom and shower. He really provides everything that one would need to discover London, or in my case, make a more long term move here. He was able to provide loads of information on transport and neighborhoods, and makes you feel very comfortable in the house. The neighborhood of Oval  is close to so many interesting areas, and is a great jumping off point to embark from. <br/>I highly recommend a stay here!"

But it never happened and the kitchen was well equipped. Our room in Matthew's house was really nice and comfortable. Although Matthew life in the same house we ever have our privacy when we wanted to have it.<br/>He Location was well, too. It was in short distance to the tube station from where we get to all points in the town in a few minutes.<br/>All in all i am really happy that we choose Matthews apartment and that he allowed us to stay there.

Le quartier est calme et la chambre mise à disposition par Matthew très propre et très claire.<br/>Notre hôte était, quant à lui, à la fois très discret et très disponible et nous avons eu beaucoup de plaisir à échanger avec lui. Toujours avenant et plein de bons conseils, nous avons beaucoup apprécié ce séjour chez lui.<br/>Hébergement idéal pour un couple même si le coin sanitaire est réduit mais disposer de douche et de toilettes accessibles directement de la chambre est un ""+"" non négligeable.

When we arrived, Matthew spent a great deal of time, at my request, printing a voucher that I needed for the Tower of London.  I'm sure it was a great inconvenience for him, but I really appreciated his kindness in doing that. He also allowed us to do some laundry, which was also extremely appreciated.<br/><br/>The apartment was really convenient, in that the bathroom was directly connected to the room in which we stayed.

This was our first airbnb experience and we were thrilled with how well it all worked out.  Matthew was very helpful in communicating all the details regarding directions, London transportation, etc.  He was a very gracious host - very helpful but definitely not 'in your face'.  The place itself was just perfect for us.  It was clean, quiet and well-appointed and we felt like we had privacy.  The location was also very handy - we had large bags that we were managing and the short 3-5 minute walk from the tube/bus station was very manageable and easy.  HIs place felt like a quiet refuge from the hustle and crowds on London. <br/>I would not hesitate to highly recommend Matthew's place - it was well-located, clean, quiet and calm and Matthew was helpful and respectful."

72913,35447795,19-06-2015,5346077,Eve,"Matthews place is a wonderful spot for exploring London. He is close to a Northern line tube station and you can get most anywhere easily from there. The space is just as he describes it, I loved the views into the gardens. Matthew was helpful and suggested a few places to visit that had not made my list, I was so glad I heeded his advice, the sites were excellent. He also had great advise on dining, local events, and just general getting around. I hope to come back to London some day and will definitely check his room availability first!"

Дом недалеко от метро и центра Лондона, но район довольно тихий и зеленый. мы остались довольны."
72913,38578784,17-07-2015,19943767,Jessica,Mathew was a great host and made our first Airbnb experience a success. He was very prompt with all correspondence and sent some very helpful directions to help us get to his apartment. His flexible check in time was very much appreciated after such a long international flight. The room and apartment were exactly as this pictures show and I would not hesitate to recommend his house to others. Thank-you Mathew! 
72913,51278596,19-10-2015,541786,Cristina,"This was already my second time at Matthews place. No need to say that I liked it a lot. I like the neighborhood, tube and everything you need are just around the corner. The room itself is small but very cozy and nicely furnished. Matthew is a great host. He made our check-in really easy, and was helpful and understanding to special needs because of allergies. Thanks so much!"

72913,64833027,08-03-2016,1104349,Brad,"I stayed with my partner at Matthew's place for three nights in March. Matthew's place is beautiful, as captured in the photos, a gem hidden behind a modest frontage. The bed is large and luxurious and the upstairs bedroom quiet, private and spacious, though the toilet and bathroom are small and require some co-ordination to get in and out of. The location was perfect for us - easy to get in and out of the city and a quick journey to Southbank - for Borough and the Tate. There is a lovely pub nearby but for more shops and eateries you'd be wise to head to Brixton. Matthew was  efficient and helpful in every way. From first inquiry through to check out. A perfect host. I am planning a return visit. "
72913,65576111,15-03-2016,3921304,Bettina,"Matthew was a great host, very friendly and his tips were very welcome by us. The house is very nice furnished (it's the style we like somuch). The house is very clean and our room was oriented to the backyard in a very silent neighbourhood so sleeping was of no problem.<br/>In summer I'm sure one can use the nice garden in the backyard which wasn't possible during our stay in March.<br/>We can really recommend Matthew's place and we will memorize the place for another trip.<br/>Thank you Matthew for our pleasant stay."

The room was spacious and quiet - I was able to do some work and watch a bit of TV at the end of the day. There was also a nice sense of privacy with the separate bathroom and shower adjoined to the room.<br/><br/>The house was very close to Oval station, and the London tube makes it very easy to travel the inner and outer city. Overall, I very much enjoyed my stay and occasional chats with Matthew!"

He has a very nice house and it was kept up very nice, including his amazing garden.  Really liked having our own shower and toilet.

The room itself was fantastic! Clean and comfortable, no complaints at all! Has a great view of the gardens behind the house as well. The rest of the house was also very clean and lovely. We only made breakfast in the kitchen, but it had everything we needed!<br/>As far as Matthew, he is wonderful! Great with communication, from our initial inquiry to the entire time we stayed.  He provides plenty of tips/tricks/recommendations for London and the area around him for food, places to see, and any other big questions you may have. He also would check-in throughout the visit to make sure all is well and see if anything else is needed too.  He also was around to see us off as well! <br/>Definitely recommend this host/location!

It is so lovely after being out, to come into Matthew’s house and garden to find it quiet (except for the sounds of cheering from the cricket games going on in the Oval Friday evenings!). Matthew is a great host who does his best to make you feel welcome. The location is great, so convenient to travel from Gatwick, and to and from other places in the city. <br/>My best recommendations!"

It was especially convenient for me since I needed to visit the US embassy (25 mins walk). The house is very peaceful and I was able to do work and remote conferences easily. Matthew was accommodating and a great host. The room was clean, bright, and comfortable. One thing to note for taller/bigger people is that the shower and the bathroom is on the smaller/narrow side. Overall, it was a great stay."

By the end of the week, it felt as if we'd known her for years. <br/><br/>The bed was really comfortable with wonderful cotton sheets and the room had lots of storage space and light. We felt comfortable using the kitchen and living room whenever we wanted a cup of tea or to make some food and Anna left fruit and cereal out for us every day, which was lovely.<br/><br/>It was a very good stay and we'd recommend her to anyone coming to London. The flat is in a lovely safe area with lots to do. Well worth a visit!"

Bathroom and kitchen are modern fitted, bathtub is superb.<br/>The street is very quiet and after long days walking around London we had wonderful rest.<br/>Anna is a amazing, warm and welcoming person, with a lot of humor and always helpful. We had nice and entertaining  chats with her in the kitchen. She helped us with our English and in turn we taught her some Italian words and some healthy recipes which she really appreciated.<br/>Anna is one of the warmest and kindhearted person we have ever met. Her place is really cosy and in a lovely area. <br/>Links to the city center are great with tube and train connections at very short walk distance (10 mins).

The rest of the house was clean and very lovely.  <br/>Location it is a 10 min walk or a quick bus ride to clapham south (zone 2) or balham tube station is closer but in zone 3. We were very happy with the location and alway felt safe walking home at night <br/>Anna is a warm and loving person who would make any house guest feel welcome. She goes out of her way to accommodate you and make sure all your needs are met. The moment we met Anna we felt comfortable with her. It honestly felt like a home away from home.

73125,6779018,25-08-2013,6586609,Anni,"Have just come home from 3 wonderful weeks at Annas place in London. Anna is the most lovely woman you can ever meet, friendly, warm, helpfull i every way - a perfect host. We had a lot of good talks with a lot of laghfter and seriusnes. She shared her food with us, if we were at home and helped us in any way. The flat we could use as if it was our own and the garden as well. It was much more than we had expected. The place is just as it says in the advertisement. The area is also very nice and friendly.  And for the distance to places to go it was perfect. We had decided only to take the bus - you don't see anything from tre tube - and you can go anywere from Annas place with only two busroutes or less depending where you want to go. It was very easy - take the busplan at the tubestation and find your way around to everything - easy. There was also a lot of shops and places to eat nearby. If you want a good meal for a few pounds go to the Moon under Water. It's good food in a pub with a great english atmosphere. It seemed to be the second diningroom for some of the people, who came there. Very cosy. We can highly recommend this place to anyone, who wants to go to London. We surely will come back next time, we want to stay in London."

She is a great host and goes the extra mile to make sure you enjoy your stay and are organized for your time in London. If you want company to have a cuppa with, she is the perfect candidate. However if you also want time to relax she is very mindful of a traveller's love of down time.<br/>Her house, room and bathroom are very clean. Facilities are fantastic and I would definitely recommend staying with her.

In line with all the previous reviews, I would also mention that she is an amazing host. When she said the apartment is clean, it was spotless. Kitchen was great with all the imaginable utensils, and the washer dryer and bathroom are very large and more than fully functional. And then there is the backyard... imagine sitting in a garden with a fresh brew during the British summer. Can anything be better than that? I doubt ...<br/>Good to know things: Anna is very amicable and very attentive to your needs. The apartment is on the ground floor so perfect for anyone with reduced mobility or traveling heavy. <br/>In a nutshell, just stay here. You will have a blast."

If you opt for the daily/weekly pass you can take the bus from the main road to the station. In which case it’s a 7 min walk to the bus stand. Restaurant options are better towards Balham South Station. <br/>It was my first visit to London and I was quite anxious. Settled well on day 1 itself. Anna is quite reassuring. Just go by Anna’s advise and you will be comfortable! <br/>Beautiful garden, quiet place, cosy room and a lovely host! Anna is kind, and is an absolute gem. She’s quite engaging and humorous.

Within the enclave itself, Anna's guests can look forward to a good night's sleep, as  there is little traffic or neighbourhood noise.<br/>Anna is careful about hygiene, especially in the bedroom and bath areas. The bathtub and shower have good water pressure. The bed is comfortable; both the quilt and pillows are down-filled. After the first night, on learning of a hypersensitivity to feathers, Anna replaced the duvet and the pillows with high-quality synthetic bed coverings, which was much appreciated. <br/>It is a pleasure to recommend Anna's Airbnb. With Anna you can count respect and enthusiasm for attending to her guests' needs. Here she excels."

She gave great recommendations and also allowed me to borrow a UK charger.<br/>The bedroom was private, and the bathroom, kitchen, living room, and garden were shared spaces. Breakfast was included and Anna was thoughtful enough to buy me vegan breakfast foods. The bed and pillows were comfortable, the shower felt great, and the washer and dryer worked well.<br/>The neighborhood was residential and quiet. Anna's home wasn't by the main tourist attractions in Central London, but it was right by Belham train station and the bus stop, so it was very easy to get wherever I needed to go.<br/>I wasn't able to get the bedroom door to lock from inside the room or on the outside of the room my second night there. Anna and I inspected it and it appears it may have broken. I'm sure Anna will get this fixed for future guests.<br/>This home is highly recommend!"

(Victoria Line).<br/><br/>I have already recommended the room to family, and would now like to recommend it to any prospective travellers to the area.<br/><br/>Emi is a fantastic cook and sent us off with a beautifully cooked and tateful breakfast of the finest ingredients. So if you get a chance to taste his breakfast, then please don't hesitate.<br/><br/>Both are knowledgeable of the city and ready to give a hand if you need help in finding your way. <br/><br/>We didn't actually have so much time with our hosts, being on a busy schedule, but what time we did have was spent i pleasant conversation..<br/><br/>Hope to stay again on a later trip. :)<br/><br/>"

Brixton is a district in full swing, cheerful. that say more .... I do not think I could find better.<br/>I recommend it"
73431,9166598,10-12-2013,10011898,John,"I STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!  This is a great alternative to a pricey place in the middle of London, as it's only 4 tube stops away from Victoria Station.<br/><br/>My experience at Emi and Simon's 'airbnb' was BEYOND MY EXPECTATIONS.  The room was: simply and beautifully decorated; absolutely clean; bright; private; there was plenty of space in the downstairs entrance to the loft bedroom for someone bringing lots of luggage; a chic, ultra-modern private bathroom for guest use; close to the tube station; very reasonably priced... and oh yes, right beside the funky Brixton Market with several places to shop and eat well at very reasonable prices.  It's difficult to imagine a nicer B&B.  Kudos and thank you, Emi and Simon! "

Emiliano will provide you with everything you could possibly need, from plug adaptors and hair drier, to a lot of useful information, books and guides about London. Emiliano and Simon are definitely two lovely and helpful hosts! <br/>Then, Brixton is a strategic place to stay, you can get to the centre in just a 15minutes underground trip, and the neighbour is very interesting and full of nice pubs and multi-ethnic restaurants.<br/>So, all things considered, we warmly recommend Emi's place, it will make you really enjoy your stay in London! <br/>(and, last but not least, the price is more than fair for the kind of accomodation!)<br/> "

We were treated to an English breakfast which was so good it could have been prepared by a fancy restaurant. We would definitely recommend Emi and Simon. <br/>Brixton itself was an interesting location to hop off from. The flat is literally next door to the Brixton Village Market which has many small independent restaurants that give you a real feel for the neighbourhood.

73431,10192240,05-02-2014,10369297,Irene,"Cuando llegamos a casa de Emi y Simon era muy tarde, pero no tuvieron problema en esperarnos y darnos indicaciones, algo que agradecimos enormemente. Además, la limpieza era impecable y la casa muy acogedora. Nos ayudaron mucho dejándonos las targetas para viajar en el metro y mucha información sobre Brixton y Londres.<br/>Todo Perfecto.<br/>Sin duda, volveríamos!"
73431,10285160,10-02-2014,3341004,Inés,"Just perfect! Lovely bedroom, nice bathroom and perfect shower, all very brand new and super clean.<br/>Emi and Simon are the perfect hosts, they gave us a lot of information and facilities to enjoy London. The situation was perfect, only 4 stations to the center and Brixton village are full of cheap and nice places to eat or have a drink. You must book Emi´s room"
73431,10417472,18-02-2014,3994025,Hsiao-Chi,The apartment/room is very clean and comfortable. Both Emi and Simon are nice hosts. Highly recommended to everyone!

73431,10616334,28-02-2014,11031356,Geoffroy,"Emi and Simon were perfect during our stay.<br/>So Welcoming.<br/>The room is very nice. Brixton as London is alive.<br/>The proximity of Brixton Village is very useful after a day of visit or shopping.<br/>The city center is so close with the Victoria line, very convenient.<br/>Highly recommended."
73431,24237959,23-12-2014,23844486,Matina,"Emi was a great host. Very communicative and incredibly efficient at keeping in contact, before and during our stay. The location, apartment and very high standard were all factors that made our trip brilliant. It felt like home and was very comfortable with every mod con you could think of!! Would definitely recommend, it ticks all the boxes!"

73431,25229859,10-01-2015,7327740,Lucie,"Great apartment in bustling Brixton. A well looked after place, and very comfortable with its large space. Hosts were easy to co-ordinate with even though they were out of the country at the time. Close proximity to Brixton village market which was great for cafes and restaurants. Easy reach to central London. We had a fantastic stay all round."
73431,25850329,27-01-2015,12076392,Jay,Value for money given such a nice place
73431,26359241,10-02-2015,13933190,Teresa,"Fantastico soggiorno! Posizione ottima per raggiungere il centro di Londra, nelle vicinanze del Brixton Village delizioso mercatino. Emiliano e Simone accoglienti padroni di casa, il loro appartamento é splendido. Grazie di tutto!"
73431,26781907,19-02-2015,10481398,David,"Me and my girlfriend stayed at Emi's and Simon's room for one week. Everything was well organized. Emi responded fast, polite and helpful. The building is very modern, with a friendly concierge service and an elevator to get to the flat on the top floor, which is also very modern and tidy. The bed in our room is the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on! It's important to notice that the bedroom stretches across two floors and that you can close a door for some privacy. You have your own bathroom with a nice modern shower. The TV and the Laptop with printer are a nice addition. The rest of the flat is gorgeous as well - especially the filtered water-tap (hot, cold and sparkling) and the comfortable sofa. <br/><br/>The location of the flat is great with a Tube station in close range and a lot of restaurants as well as Brixton market / village in the vicinity. <br/><br/>We really enjoyed our stay at Emi's and Simon's place. They were great hosts and provided us with shopping tips. I strongly recommend staying there. It was a great experience.    "
73431,29438668,07-04-2015,21500486,Chong,Very lovely house. Emi is a extraordinary house manager who prepared everything we need. 
73431,29773167,12-04-2015,4523519,Julius,Great people. Great place. Great Location. Would definitely recommend it.
73431,30406934,21-04-2015,30119790,Bernhard,"With the given directions we easily found the modern building, and deposited keys. <br/><br/>Our room, the bathroom and the entire apartment was exceptionally well kept and clean.  The phone, WIFI and even a dedicated guest computer worked instantly and fast, and were really helpful to manage our flight's delayed luggage. <br/><br/>Our hosts were very friendly and welcoming and provided us with up-to-date hints and advice on interesting places in the environment.  Before booking, we had never even heard of this part of town.  The house is in a calm backyard, but nearby is a very vivid neighbourhood with street markets, lots of places to go out, and we enjoyed trying out various restaurants in the vicinity.  The nearby tube station swiftly connects to the city center.  <br/><br/>All was perfect for our short holiday.  We both were extremely happy with this comfy place during the entire week.  Four thumbs up!"
73431,32312968,17-05-2015,25588771,Charlie,Everything at Emi and Simon's place was lovely! We loved staying there and it always felt like home. Having such amazing hosts and a comfy bed to come home too after a long day of touring London was a great first experience traveling in Europe. We always felt safe at their home and it's closeness to the underground was fabulous! Thank you again Emi and Simon for being so helpful and accommodating! 
73431,32918021,23-05-2015,29693529,Rebecca,"THIS IS AN AMAZING SPACE!! Emi and Simon go out of their way to be INCREDIBLY welcoming and accommodating. They're just the sweetest people in the world. You also get SO MUCH ROOM for an amazing price. Everything was clean and neat. My friend and I didn't see Emi or Simon much throughout our stay, but when we did the interactions were always lovely. I just cannot rave about this place enough. My friend and I fell IN LOVE with Brixton - the area is incredible! So close to the center of London, but Brixton itself is so cool we stayed in the neighborhood for a few nights of our stay.<br/><br/>Again, I cannot recommend this space enough! If you're looking for amazing, safe, and spacious living accommodations with wonderful hosts, look no further! Seriously. This is it."
73431,33679246,31-05-2015,13897434,Megan,"Staying with Emi and Simon was fantastic! The flat was immaculate and had everything you could possibly need for a short break in London. My boyfriend and I especially loved the area as it was surrounded by loads of fantastic stalls and 'pop up' restaurants with food from around the world. Brixton was a great location for getting into the centre to see all of London's main attractions too. Simon and Emi were the perfect hosts, providing us with lots of really good information on where to eat etc. as well as allowing us to do our own thing and pop in and out of the flat whenever. We had an amazing time - Thanks Guys :D "
73431,34207500,06-06-2015,30940013,Victor,"This space was so much more than we expected. Everything in this flat is state of the art, beautiful, and clean! The space that was set aside for us was closed off and felt very private. (The bedroom was upstairs with its own foyer on the bottom floor with a door to close it off) The bathroom, however, did not feel as private because it was located by the living area/kitchen. <br/>The location of the apartment was perfect for adventurers like us. It was close enough to the main sights (about a 10-15 minute travel) but far enough away that it didn't feel too touristy. The best part of the location is that it is right next door to the Brixton market which has amazing food from different nationalities. <br/>All in all I would say our experience here was very positive and I would definitely recommend to anyone. <br/>*one thing to note is that when it is very hot you have to open the windows to cool the bedroom. There are trains that pass right outside of the flat. As long as the big windows were closed the noise was not a problem, but with the windows opened it was a bit loud. "
73431,35308867,17-06-2015,31511906,Veronica,"La habitación está excelente, en todo momento tienes privacidad, es un lugar bastante limpio, el departamento en general es bastante agradable, contar con un baño solo para tu disposición es priceless. Emi y Simón son bastante agradables, muy amables, excelentes anfitriones. El departamento se encuentra bastante cerca de todas las atracciones que exigen a lo largo del río Támesis, excelente ubicación. "
73431,35619163,20-06-2015,27351915,Xumin,"Emi and Simon are very friendly, always kept in touch with us before we arrived. They also prepared an house manual which provide a lot of information for us travelling in London. Moreover, we love their place, it is really nice and clean. We feel comfortable in there."
73431,35922990,23-06-2015,12804073,Lindsey,"Emi and Simon where amazing host! The flat is everything you could want and more! From the moment we arrived we felt welcomed and the flat was so clean and was decorated really cute.  The location is great, about a 5 minute walk to the tube station and there are close grocery stores near by! The Brixton area is very lively and is a cool part of London! I would HIGHLY recommend staying with Emi and Simon because you won't be disappointed :) "
73431,36678204,30-06-2015,7435305,Joel,"The house is impeccably furnished and Emi gave plenty of good instructions on how to get to the apartment and its functions. Although the apartment is shared, there is sufficient privacy. The location is also convenient to travel around London and the price is great value for money for London accommodation"
73431,37197661,05-07-2015,31872609,Anny,Very clean house and Emi is very nice .very good experience in london.
73431,39207654,21-07-2015,6616693,Andy,"Our trip was excellent and everything about the booking and the apartment exceeded our expectations. Emi communicated clearly and promptly before our visit and was helpful in taking delivery of some tickets before we arrived. The location of the apartment is very fairly described and is very handy for trips into central London and the many and varied pleasures of Brixton. The whole apartment, bed, bathroom,  kitchen was excellently presented, sparkling clean and the invitations to use all of its facilities generous and clear. Unfortunately, the host and I are in formal Airbnb dispute about what is a reasonable cost for us to pay for damage to a fragile fitting on a set of blinds that broke in the wind when we opened the door on arriving at the apartment. The blinds have now been broken in this way three times in the 18 months since they were installed - with a claimed repair cost of £90 a pop. There is no warning of the fragility of the blinds. I have offered 50% of the costs - we shall see how the airbnb dispute resolution works out."
73431,44423905,26-08-2015,35527899,Giovanna Maria,"Emiliano wasn't there when we arrived to his house, but immediately we felt at home. The house is full of comfort, we couldn't hope better. <br/>Brixton is a really nice and enjoyable district; the house is near both markets and nightlife places. Near to tube station, too.<br/>Gli italiani si troveranno a loro agio in un ambiente a loro familiare. La bella casa di Emi va ben al di là di ogni aspettativa, meglio di quanto le foto e l'annuncio possano rendere. Massima pulizia, il che non è poco.<br/>We hope to come back to Emi's house very soon, it will be a pleasure for us. Thank you a lot.<br/>Giovanna e Giuseppe"
73431,60697610,26-01-2016,37377901,Víctor,"This is not a house, but a palace! It's an amazing apartment, where attention has been paid to even the smallest detail. The location is absolutely perfect, right next to Brixton Market and just a few minutes walking from the underground station. I did not get the chance to meet Emi, but his housemate was always there for whatever I needed."
73431,123457029,29-12-2016,23692663,Vincent,Tres bel appartement situé dans le quartier pittoresque de Brixton. Facile d'accés en métro. Plus pour 2 couples ou un couple avec 1 seul enfant. Tres bien équipé et 2 salle de bain. Ensoleillé avec deux belles vues sur Londres. Le propriétaire est adorable. Bon vous etes a Londres donc tout est cher....rapport qualité prix correct. On recommande !
73431,125950049,08-01-2017,5144651,Amandine,"Très bon séjour chez Emi, l'appartement est moderne, agréable et propre. A notre disposition une jolie chambre avec sa propre salle de bain.  Le petit point faible est qu'elle donne sur la voie ferrée mais après de grosses journées de visite de Londres cela ne gêne pas vraiment le sommeil. <br/>L'appartement est situé à Brixton qui est un quartier à découvrir, atypique. Idéal pour découvrir Londres à 5min du métro ."
73431,134947467,02-03-2017,29085301,Alison,"What a find...Emi's place is sensational, a private oasis right next to both the tube, the overground station and the renowned Brixton markets.  <br/>The apartment is immaculate and beautifully decorated - I have no idea how Emi and his partner and his housemate can be so neat and uncluttered!  Although I did not meet Emi he kept in contact by text, and I briefly met his lovely friend Kate when I first arrived.  The bed was wonderfully comfortable, the ensuite bathroom a huge bonus, and although the railway ran right outside the window I was undisturbed by any train noise.  <br/>If I had to find any downside then all I can scrape from my memory is that the instant hot water was not hot enough for my tea (and I couldn't find a kettle), and the water itself was very oddly so soft that it felt difficult to rinse soap off - I don't think this can be a Brixton thing as my son lives in the area and he doesn't have the same problem, so may be just the apartment complex perhaps? <br/>Otherwise faultless....<br/>"
73431,136080267,08-03-2017,6004739,Chloé,"L'appartement est encore plus beau en vrai. Magnifique lieu décoré et aménagé avec soin. <br/>L'emplacement est génial. Très très près des restaurants de tout genre et pour tous les goûts. À moins de 5 min du métro de de nombreux bus. Quartier vivant, artistique et très local. <br/>Nous avions la chambre de<br/>Emi puisqu'il était en voyage. Cette chambre a une salle de bain privée et une magnifique vue sur toute la ville. Malgré le fait que Emi était absent il était très facile à rejoindre. Sa coloc, avec qui nous habituons, était très sympathique mais nous l'avons presque pas vue. C'est un peu comme si nous avions eu un appartement à nous seuls! "
73431,139975257,27-03-2017,56584164,Fabrizio,"L'appartamento si trova in un edificio moderno e sicuro, in un quartiere vivace e multietnico. Vicino all'appartamento troverete un mercato coperto con offerte gastronomiche di alto livello. La metropolitana si raggiunge in pochi minuti a piedi. L'appartamento è luminoso, moderno e curatissimo. Vi troverete sicuramente bene! L'host è davvero molto disponibile e preciso nelle indicazioni fornite. Torneremo sicuramente... "
73431,143178436,10-04-2017,109713300,Nadine,"Emi was a wonderful host for my sister and I. He was very accommodating as we booked extremely last minute! The apartment is very nice and new. The only drawback for us was how small the room was, not a lot of space for our stuff. Honestly, we weren't there too often, as we really wanted to explore London, so no big deal. Brixton is a very cool, up and coming area, and it was fun to hang out at the Brixton marketplace area literally next door to the apartment building. "
73431,146945270,24-04-2017,75943997,Kevin,The apartment was very beautiful and clean! Thanks to Emi we could have many information about where to eat and all the stuff to do in London. <br/>Great location and wonderful apartment
73431,158155875,05-06-2017,25753426,Shawna,This is a very nice apartment in a secure property that was extremely close to a vibrant and eclectic part of the city within walking distance to transportation. Other than a misunderstanding regarding the accommodations offered versus what we received this was a fabulous place with high end amenities.  
73431,166440907,03-07-2017,2995029,Lena,I booked Emi's place for my parents when they came to visit me in London. Communication before the trip was perfect and my parents really enjoyed their stay in this beautiful appartment. Thanks!
73431,223990758,02-01-2018,42711347,Brid,This appartment is amazing - it is great having the markets close by and the tube station is on a great line so staying local or going out really works. brillant

73431,294051528,21-07-2018,8405749,Dylan,Immaculately clean and comfortable apartment. Everything as described in the listing. Loved having the coffee machine and sparkling water tap to use. Well located near Brixton Village with easy access to transport. Highly recommended.
73431,506193815,10-08-2019,34643821,Raymond,"The apartment exceeded my expectations in most ways. Physically, it was loaded with amenities, including a whole bean coffee machine (loaded with beans). It had a spectacular view of London in two directions, north and south. Since it is located in Brixton, in South London, the northerly view was spectacular, showing the entire skyline, east to west.<br/>The apartment was very conveniently located, just a short walk from the Brixton station on the Victoria line. We found it very easy to reach central London from the apartment. The Brixton neighborhood has a lively and interesting nightlife scene and market.<br/>My only caveat is that the apartment is located next to a major commuter rail line that serves Brixton, so it was rather noisy. However, when shut the windows eliminated most of the noise.<br/>All in all, I was very happy with my stay at Emi's apartment. In terms of location, the views, and the very comfortable apartment itself, I would stay there again next time I am traveling to London."
73431,510054272,15-08-2019,30407420,Brandi And Kyle,Emi’s place is very clean and a very nice apartment. It is located in a locked apartment complex with a concierge so it’s an extremely safe location. There is a shopping villainess right next door with cute shops and great food. The subway is very close as well making travel around London really easy!

Highly recommend if you are visiting the great city of London!  Loved their coffeemaker Thanks Emi. I may be calling on you again!!
73431,612230883,29-02-2020,90364621,Silvia,"Me and my partner spent a week at Emi’s place with our nearly 2 yo son which felt very comfortable from the first day and slept well every night in his lovely cot <br/>(parents know how difficult it is to travel with small kids)<br/>The apartment is very clean, stylish, bright and comfortable, with everything you need, and as other review said it looks better in person that in pictures.<br/>The location is spot on and you can reach central london and other areas very quickly.<br/>We definitely recommend this place and will keep in mind for next visit to London"
73431,655970593,24-08-2020,58903049,Molly,Brilliant stay in a lovely apartment. Everything was very smooth with lots of lovely little touches to make it feel more like a hotel than an air bnb! Thank you for having us.

We had a smooth checkin everything was spotlessly clean, bright and airy. The beds are really comfy and there are nice touches in the apartment like a coffee maker, induction hob and washer/dryer. <br/>EMI was also kind to offer us a late check out as we were travelling later in the day. <br/>The instruction manual for the appliances and check out procedure was very helpful. <br/>I would thoroughly recommend Emi’s place especially for families. (2 bathrooms, a lift, safety features throughout the apartment, plenty of room for everyone) <br/>Thanks EMI🙏"

The comunication with Emi was good.  But if one is sensetive of noise it is better to have earplugs in ones suitcase because trains are directly under your window. Nonetheless everything was perfect.

73431,6.93249E+17,14-08-2022,18475247,Tom,Emi's place is great.    Very methodical instructions and communication.    The flat is very clean and has everything you need for a pleasant stay.    We especially liked the water faucet that provided sparkling water on demand...:)   Building is secure and easy to get to from the Brixton tube station.       The area is fantastic - a multicultural mix with a great food market and more right next door.       Will be enjoyed by anyone who wants to get a slice of London outside of the tourist zone.        Trains are a little noisy but part of the Brixton London experience.
73431,7.04847E+17,30-08-2022,184636653,Allen,"We had a lovely stay at Emi's place. The flat is so we'll thought out and maintained. We were always being pleasantly surprised by the little details and useful things we would find daily. Our toddler son was absolutely delighted to see the trains passing by and also there were airplanes frequently flying above the flat much to his amazement and joy!! We were also happy to see some lovely book collection. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and left inspired by the decor, orderliness and convenience of Emi's house."

73431,8.40483E+17,05-03-2023,478414537,Claudia,"The apartment was very clean, felt cozy. It was spacious, bright, close to Brixton station. Transportation to downtown was easy. Fair price.<br/>It was difficult to find the address in the beginning. Apple maps took me by the back of the building. I did not like the location. The train runs in the back, the food market is close by. For some people is convenient, but not for me. The smell of fish and meat is strong when you walk towards the station and you cant avoid seeing homeless people sleeping on the streets."
73431,8.45545E+17,12-03-2023,71531372,Nils,"Great lovely place with modern, clean and easy to use appliances . Emi was super friendly and responsive. Brixton is a great, multicultural district with lots of good food and drinks. Tube to the city center is near by. Highly recommended."
73431,8.50608E+17,19-03-2023,298092274,Yi Ki,"Great location, just a jew minutes walk from the underground station.<br/>The place is very safe. Check in was quite smooth.<br/>Good facilities and clean as well.<br/>Emi provided a very detailed instructions about the place and things to do around that area.<br/>Supermarkets are located around the stay.<br/>You can go to different sightseeing spots by buses, trains and underground.<br/>10 out of 10!"
73431,8.66498E+17,10-04-2023,10371143,Jose,"Estuvimos muy cómodos, el departamento tenía todo lo necesario estaba muy limpio, queda cerca al metro"
73431,9.02E+17,29-05-2023,232508809,Valerie,Très bel appartement bien sécurisé . De jolies fleurs dans les vases. Agréable. Hôte accueillant qui donne beaucoup de recommandations.
73431,9.23041E+17,27-06-2023,253554457,Patty,"Emi’s place was great for the group of 4 of us. The views in the living room and master bedroom were amazing. The water and sparkling water filter were also a great amenity and we used it often, we did have to turn it off and back on a couple of times for it to work when it would stop dispensing water. Just something to note for those who might be light sleepers, an overground train runs by the bedrooms which can be pretty loud at times."
73431,9.47675E+17,31-07-2023,282488831,Gillian,"We stayed at Emi's apartment for 3 nights.  The apartment was ideally situated for our needs.  We arrived into Euston station (from Manchester) and within half an hour we were at the apartment via the Victoria Line.  Emi had kindly let us drop our bags early before the official check in, which made our afternoon/evening much more enjoyable for sightseeing.<br/>We found the apartment (about a 7 min walk from Brixton tube) easily and felt safe and at home there.  There are great views of the London City skyline.  It was a great base to do the usual London sightseeing but if you'd like to explore a non-touristy bit of London, then I'd wholly recommend Brockwell Park (about a 15 minute walk south of the apartment).  We had a great walk around the park and there is a fantastic adventure playground there which our 7 year old loved.  We also explored the local food market (Sunday) at Herne Hill.<br/>If we'd been without our son, we'd have definitely sampled the buzzing nightlife that was close by."
73431,9.49922E+17,03-08-2023,90816137,Laura,"My family of four had a great stay at Emi’s place. The flat is very clean, comfortable and has everything needed for a pleasant stay. The train runs right outside the bedroom which is something to keep in mind for light sleepers. Brixton area is vibrant, would definitely stay again. Highly recommend Emi’s flat!"

Our room was very clean and the bed very comfortable and the shower was great.<br/><br/> The free minibar in our room is a very generous touch but then they were also generous in terms of being able to help ourselves to fruit, etc., from the kitchen, make our own sandwiches and hot drinks. On the first night, Adrian even cracked open a bottle of red wine, which was most enjoyable. <br/><br/>The house was just a straight forward 15 minutes drive from Wimbledon and we parked in one of the private houses on Princes Way for £15, which allowed us to get in the queue as early as we liked. It was also very handy to park our car on their drive - off road - overnight.<br/><br/>I would not hesitate to recommend staying with Danielle & Adrian for similar trips not only because of the excellent value but also because they are so nice and hospitable. Infact, Adrian even provided me with an ice pack for my poorly knee and some ibuprofen!<br/><br/>We stayed 23 June to 26 June 2013.<br/><br/>Thanks Danielle & Adrian - hope to be back for next year!"
79129,5408133,28-06-2013,7124986,David,"Danielle and Adrian were great hosts, their house was lovely and room was very comfortable, it even had a mini-bar. Highly recommended!"
79129,5630418,08-07-2013,7168756,Ganesh,"People: Adrian is a wonderful host, who understands people and their cultures. Danielle is a friendly person. We felt like staying at friend's home, rather than a B&B. <br/>Place: It's a calm and quiet place, with a sit-out-garden at backyard. The bedroom got everything inside - comfy bed, books, CDs, fridge, audio player, TV and not to mention about travel-guide-leaflets. Safe parking space with close access to bus/tube lines.<br/>Breakfast: Nice English breakfast with a variety of tea options, fruits, etc. "

They both were very helpful and friendly.<br/><br/>Room was big enough for two of us, our small dog and even for my computer desk that I needed during the stay :-) It had plenty of drinks for free like coffee, tea or spirits. You also get your own mini fridge! :-) I remember that we got chocolates and treats for our dog when we arrived as a welcome. Bed was soft and comfortable and you can see trees and park from the big window.<br/><br/>Morden is quiet and safe place to be. You have number of different parks around you including one just behind the house. Also a bus station is very close and tube station is only a short walk away.<br/><br/>I'm happy to recommend this place!"

It was first time we used airbnb and it was the best experience. The house is in nice and quiet location, not too far from centre of London. We were there for sightseeing in London so we traveled by tube every day and it was easy to get there. There was to much goods to eat for breakfast and we enjoyed it in their beautiful garden. Our room was really tidy and there was comfortable bed. We could not be more satisfied . We can recommend to everybody! We are so happy that we met both of them and spent the time there. "

They are considerate, kind, caring, conscientious, relaxed and fun. <br/><br/>The room and bath was as advertised and we found it met all expectations. It was comfortable, very well appointed, organized, and clean. The space was also quiet as the windows open to a green space and the sweet night breezes made sleeping very comfortable as well as waking to the songbirds each morning. <br/><br/>We enjoyed our time in their home so much that we often would rather relax in their beautiful garden than go into the city to sightsee - which is saying a lot considering they are situated in a world class tourism city. "
79129,14777318,26-06-2014,14603702,Sally,"We have recently returned from a short stay with Danielle and Adrian, having attended the Wimbledon Championships.  Well...what can we say?<br/><br/>Upon arrival we were met by two friendly faces, who with a warm welcome made us feel at home straight away.  Throughout our two-day stay this continued with our hosts, especially Adrian as Danielle was busy working and with Adrian working from home, being extremely hospitable, accommodating and friendly. An example of this was when we were offered the use of their guest Oyster passes and Adrian even nipped out on our evening of arrival to top them up (all included with the price of our stay)!<br/><br/>Our room was excellent and extremely comfortable.  Little touches, chocolates, shortbread and a fully stocked fridge with wine, beer and soft drinks, were welcomed and did not go unnoticed.  Being included in the price of our stay, it certainly exceeded our expectations.<br/><br/>This was our first visit to Wimbledon and our first experience of Airbnb, but based on this stay it will hopefully be the first of many.  We hope to visit Danielle and Adrian again in the future as we were made to feel so welcome and at ease from the offset."

Excellent communication upon our reservation and a warm and friendly welcome once we arrived. The house was lovely and the area peaceful yet with great public transport access to Wimbledon and London on the doorstep. The room itself was extremely comfortable and with everything we needed and more. The tea and coffee making facilities and mini bar in our room were such a pleasant and generous suprise as was the yummy box of chocolate shortbreads for a welcome gift. Plenty of DVD's CD'S and books also available. In the morning we were presented with  a fantastic selection of choices for breakfast...croissants, toast, cereals, fruit and coffee and juice a plenty. We enjoyed this relaxing in the tranquil garden listening to the water feature under the watchful eye of the very tame resident robin red breast.  <br/>You both are a real credit to Air bnb and your warm welcome and kind hospitality made this a very pleasant experience for us and we will certainly be visiting again and highly recommend you as hosts"

Ruime badkamer, heerlijke handdoeken, alles goed verzorgd. Adrian was enorm behulpzaam bij het vinden van restaurantjes, de slimste weg de stad in en allerlei andere dingetjes. Rustige, stille buurt en gratis op eigen terrein de auto parkeren was voor ons belangrijk, en de kosten met het openbaar vervoer de stad in vielen ontzettend mee (en Londen is zo groot het reizen kost nou eenmaal tijd, als je dat in je achterhoofd houdt valt de reistijd naar Londen enorm mee). Al met al, een fijne ervaring en we komen zeker terug!"

They were kind and helpful, even going as far as to driving me to the store to get the cat a box.<br/>The room was wonderful! It had plenty of room, the bed was big and especially comfortable. They had a mini fridge which they insisted was a help yourself policy, but I probably too it too far (sorry.) <br/>I can't stress how helpful they were. They let me borrow an Oyster card to ride the bus. If I was in my room, they left me in peace. And when I came downstairs, they let me watch tv with them.<br/>I imagine that this place is always booked due to the location and great price for what you get.

When we arrived they were very welcoming and made us, and our dog Polar, feel at home straight away. Adrian even drove us to the closest pet shop when we arrived so we could buy some food for Polar - and both Danielle and Adrian always went out of their way to help us in any way they could. <br/><br/>The room and the house were very clean and comfortable and there is a nice little yard out the back with a table where you can enjoy breakfast, a cup of tea, etc. The house is metres away from two bus stops - one which takes you into Morden (less than five minutes) where there are supermarkets, shops and the tube station, and the other which goes to Wimbledon. We found it very easy to get around London from this location. <br/><br/>We definitely recommend Danielle and Adrian's place to anyone coming to visit London!"

79129,72635364,04-05-2016,66898454,Karen,Danielle was at work but Adrian was very welcoming and made us feel at home. Worth mentioning the boiler is in the guest bedroom but didn't disturb us during our 1 night stay.

I really appreciated the complementary drinks and snacks provided by my hosts and the fast wifi needs to be mentioned as well.<br/><br/>The backyard garden was also lovely, especially for sitting down for the breakfast.<br/><br/>I was visiting London only for the weekend but I certainly wouldn't have minded staying here for longer!"

This has been the perfect BnB to give Skye and Mitch a ""start"" in London as they find their feet, a job and a more permanent place to live for the year.  <br/>Thanks Danielle.  "
79129,110743005,28-10-2016,99918050,Daniel,"This was my first Airbnb experience and thanks to the warm welcome I received from Danielle and Adrian it all went very smoothly and I was made to feel very welcome in their home.  Danielle and Adrian are a lovely couple and make a big effort so their guests have a very comfortable stay and theres plenty of food and drinks for breakfast with facilities to cook your own food should you wish.   The room I stayed in was clean, spacious and light with nice views of their beautiful garden with its various wildlife and the tree line to the neighbouring park.  I would recommend Danielle and Adrian's place 100% and would use them again should I need to be in their area.   Thank you Danielle and Adrian for making me feel so welcome."
79129,114029254,15-11-2016,13889076,Natalee,"We stayed at Danielle and Adrian's place for 2 weeks after just moving to the UK. Unfortunately Danielle was not feeling so well and busy with work and we hope she will get better soon. Adrian works from home and was very helpful with anything at all, making sure we feel welcome. They both are friendly and easy going, available for a chat but also give you plenty of privacy if you need it so that was really nice. We loved the garden and the wildlife in there, I saw a fox, squirrels, robin bird and doves. There are lots of amenities in the room and breakfast for everyday. Thanks for having us!"
79129,121655042,18-12-2016,33749035,David,"Danielle and Alex did a great job, it was a quiet and well located spot for me. I enjoyed my whistle-stop stay. I enjoyed chatting to Alex! They have created a well thought through place with great touches like the gift and plentiful drink and snack options. The room had everything you need for a long stay, so was somewhat overkill for my fleeting visit! I appreciated them taking on board my healthy suggestions of decaf tea and coffee and porridge alongside the already plentiful options. Parking was easy and I can see the walk to the tube would have been a perfectly easy alternative. All in all, airbnb at its best. Highly recommended."

It was an incredible experience that we will never forget. We got there very early and stood in the queue (5 am). We were lucky to get tickets on the central court and we saw the best players in action. <br/>Amazing hosts, they did everything to make sure the stay was great and comfortable. <br/>      Adrian was very nice and took us by car from the ground up to the house. You can also walk from their house,  almost 1 hour of walking and also you can take the tube.<br/>     We would definitely recommend this place. We are thinking of staying there for the future too.<br/>"

The bedroom was very comfortable and clean, and had lots of lovely touches like towels and toiletries and cold drinks available in the room. There was also lots of information about local transport and attractions provided. A wonderful breakfast was also laid out for us the following morning.<br/>We stayed for one night during Wimbledon week. The house is ideally located for the tennis, a public bus ride away from the courts (details in the room).<br/>We chose to do park and ride at Morden college as it's what we've done before. It's £15 for the day which includes parking and shuttle buses to and from the tennis. The college is literally 2 minutes drive from Adrian and Danielle's house so very convenient.  We can definitely recommend the park and ride, yes more expensive than the public bus but very easy!<br/>Thanks Danielle and Adrian for a fabulous stay!<br/>"

79129,171314498,17-07-2017,138729248,Robert,"This was our first foray into the world of airbnb and we really didn't know what to expect. What we found were hosts in Danielle and Adrian for whom nothing was too much trouble. Our double room was very comfortable and contained everything we could possibly need without feeling cramped - plenty of storage space, tv, mini fridge stocked with water and soft drinks, coffee and tea making facilities, hairdryer, etc. Breakfast cereals, toast, etc provided but they were happy for us to use the kitchen if we wanted to provide and cook anything more sustantial for ouselves at any time (we didn't this time, though!)  It was also lovely to be able sit in the garden to enjoy our morning coffee. Overall, we couldn't fault the welcome, the ambiance or the facilities and are happy to recommend Danielle and Adrian to any other couple looking for hosts in this area.<br/>"

The house was very clean. They offered us food and drinks for breakfast, and they provide lots of different toiletries, in case you forget something. As we were running a bit late in the last day, they even offered to give us a lift to the undergroung station! All in all, we definetelly recommend this place! Thank you both!! :)"

They are very friendly but at the same time very encouraging of guests to do their own thing. Morden Park is literally in their backyard and a real treasure for everyone, especially anyone wanting a wonderful woodsy jog, with even a little outdoors gym.  I appreciated the drive to my first appointment, and the delicious selection of breakfast cereals was a lovely touch. Thanks!"

Our comfortable bedroom was full of treats and practical touches to welcome us. We were really touched by the effort our hosts had taken to make our stay comfortable.

Their hospitality like the house itself gives an extremely warm and welcoming feeling. Top manners, conscientiousness, all sorts of amenities that number too many to recount. As well as all that, the location is brilliant, part country part town and so easy to get round to neighboring areas or central London. Haven't tried going other places from here but the tram is a short walk anyway. Even had a lovely fireworks show! Much recommended."

They are responsive to every single need of mine, and always asked if I needed anything, and provided it. There were coffee, tea, a personal mini-fridge in the bedroom, some soft-drinks and even some cocktails when I arrived, which was a very delightful touch.<br/>The area is not in the City Center, but very convenient to travel to and from. There are 2 public bus lines running frequently from the bus stop just a 2-minute walk away, which takes you to nearby town centres (Morden is the nearest, where there are Supermarkets, Restaurants, Cafes and the Northen Tube line, which goes to most places in the city centre). You can go to Wimbledon which is a little further away, but has more amenities and shopping and dining options, and connection to the District Line, or even Raynes Park, a charming neighbourhood with exquisite dining options.<br/>The nearby area is very quiet residential area, with a nice park (Morden Park) where I can walk or jog every morning. Overall, my stay far exceeded my expectations and I am delighted."

And it has been an amazing experience.<br/>Adrian and Danielle were absolutely fantastic since we booked the place. They helped us in tips for what to do. Had bread, eggs, milk and juice for us to make our breakfast. From a great washing machine, to a dining space with a great view of their garden, everything was absolutely better than what we expected. Adrian helped us in figuring out how to travel London, and what to skip or do here to save some money.<br/> The place is clean, well maintained and  is well connected to Morden and Wimbeldon underground stations. So you won't have to worry to walk more than 50m to get a bus to any of these places, at any time of the day or night. <br/>Great experience, and would definitely be back again."

79129,480316668,02-07-2019,101691539,Jack,We stayed at Adrian and Danielle's private room for our trip to Wimbledon to watch the tennis. Their house is ideally situated for people attending the championships - a short taxi/ bus ride. Their room is very clean and the bed is comfortable. Adrian and Danielle made a lot of effort to ensure we had a good stay including almost all of the amenities you could ever require and a nice breakfast. The room had a lot of thoughtful touches including a mini fridge and snacks. Highly recommend - we would stay again!

79129,483337726,07-07-2019,203084830,Tara,Really friendly and laid back place to stay. Nice and clean . Ideal if you are travelling light as they have thought of everything you may need and popped it in the room for free... including chocolates! The place is about a 15 min walk to takeaways/ restaurants which was a step too far after a full day at the tennis but it was fine to order take out and have it delivers. Breakfast included too which saved time in the morning. Great spot for getting to Wimbledon ... which is a 15 min taxi ride (£14) away or a bus and short tube ride. Will definitely stay again!
79129,484123165,08-07-2019,62242375,Helen,Lovely room with a huge array of little touches offered. Everything catered for & good communication with the hosts. Great place to stay if you are going to Wimbledon tennis! Just lovely

79129,487561913,14-07-2019,22585080,Dac,"Danielle and Adrian were super friendly hosts, their home was super clean, comfortable and the breakfast was fantastic.  Plus they are great communicators responding very quick to our messages.  Their is location is very quiet, so we got a great nights sleep.  Getting into town was easy too, as there are frequent buses running down their road and the bus stops are only minutes away.  I would definitely stay at their place again!"

Bedroom was at the back of the house so quiet location. Bedroom was clean and well presented. Bathroom was shared but not a problem and clean. Breakfast was a bonus, cereals and toast we didn't wish to cook ourselves a breakfast but I believe the option was there. Friendly and informative on arrival,  great to have an off road parking space as well."

79571,241366,26-04-2011,492091,Oliver,"Nicks studio was such a cozy place in the middle of Chesea, that we just HAVE TO recommend it to everyone!!!! Very very clean and comfy, the bed/sofa was really big for the two of us and the morning sun was just the way to feel like we were on holidays!  The warm welcome with some hints what we could do around the place were very helpful. The tube (Sloane Square) is just 5 Minutes walk away and the Kings Rd is nice and central to get all the little things you need for a stay-in. Nick prepared everything in advance and we got even a Easter bunny when we arrived! We will definetly come back-this was a great start with airbnb to stay in private homes-it just feels like beeing a Londoner;-)"
79571,250784,04-05-2011,135165,Steven,The host canceled my reservation 16 days before arrival - a shame as this apartment would have suited me perfectly. Back to the drawing board!
79571,290696,31-05-2011,554614,Clarissa,"Staying at Nick´s is just like staying at a friends´ house. He prepared everything nicely for our stay. The flat is very cosy and the sofa bed very comfy. There was a little note for us, a city map and some chocolates...<br/>The flat is in the heart of Chelsea with shops, pubs and restaurants within walking distance... strongly recommended! :-)"
79571,378950,17-07-2011,798765,Brandy,"What a great host!  Very easy to communicate with and very helpful. Flat was very clean, comfortable and in such a great location. Check out the Farmer's Market in Sloane Square Saturdays. <br/>Easy walk to either South Kensington or Sloane Square tube stations.<br/>I would 100% try to stay here again on my next visit!<br/>Thanks Nick!"
79571,531901,14-09-2011,1009277,Claudia,"Nick""s Chelsea studio was just as promised.  The location was perfect for our needs, it was clean, neat, and had everything that we needed in terms of hairdryer, tea pot, etc.  Nick was very easy to communicate with, from start to finish.  The studio is very convenient to three different tube stations, and we got around London quite easily, in no time at all.  We would definitely stay here again. "

79571,836002,04-01-2012,224979,Matthew,"Nick's flat was absolutely amazing and everything that was promised in the ad. As someone who travels to London for a month every December, I have stayed in a variety of flats (all good experiences). Nick's far and away was my favorite. It was the perfect amount of space, I slept better on the sofa bed than my own bed (the memory foam pad is amazing), and there literally is no better address/location than Chelsea. Honestly, if I could purchase this flat I would, I loved it that much. We talked quite a bit before my trip and Nick was very easy to communicate with. Not only did I find the perfect neighborhood/flat, but also gained a friend that I plan to keep in touch with. I recommend this space 100% if you are staying in London and want the ultimate Chelsea/Sloane Square experience. 5 stars all the way!!!"
79571,1135335,16-04-2012,1642965,Mandana,"This flat is wonderful and I highly recommend it.  I stayed in London with my 12 year old son for 5 nights and we loved it.  It was easy to walk to many of the sights we wanted to visit as well as the tube.  There was also a market around the corner, an ATM and plenty of restaurants.  The shower was lovely and the bed very comfortable.  I am a fan of natural light and this flat felt so cheery.  Nick was also such a warm and welcoming host and a pleasure to communicate with.  I would definitely consider staying here again and would refer my friends.  "
79571,1332034,22-05-2012,2363666,Michael,"Everything was just perfectly prepared for our arrival, drinks, towels, soap, snacks etc., the communication was excellent and very detailled via email as well as per phone and text messages, the appartment is nice and clean, close to tube stations directly to the tourist hotspots, with a nice balcony, and we even met Nicholas for a drink in the pub nearby and finally even got some of his rare homebrewn beer - yeah, there would be more to tell, so, it was absolutely great, nicholas very friendly, the sort of host you dream of, so you do not have to worry about anything!!! definetely a place to recommend!!! PS: don't miss the ethno food market on saturdays at saatchi gallery just around the corner... "
79571,2181495,03-09-2012,3115962,John,"Nick was a great host.  Although he was out of town when we stayed at his flat, he was still incredibly kind and helpful.  It was very apparent that anything we could possibly need would be instantly provided by Nick for us.  He left us some very nice refreshments and even freshly stocked the fridge for our arrival.  <br/><br/>As far as Nick's flat is concerned, it is in a great location, and has every amenity you could possibly need.  I wish we could have had more time to stay at Nick's place because it was an overall great experience!"
79571,2811456,05-11-2012,3801664,Courtney,"Absolutely perfect location! Very close to tube stations and seconds from shopping on the Kings Road. <br/><br/>Flat was clean and cosy. Even though the bed is a fold out couch it was super comfortable and you couldn't tell it was a couch! The bathroom has very modern fixtures with a great shower.<br/><br/>Kitchen has everything you need for a short stay, though no oven.<br/><br/>Easy to find, quiet neighborhood and central to get to anywhere in London very quickly. For a long weekend this was perfect for two!"
79571,166405375,03-07-2017,3499569,Andreia,Nichola's place is very well located. I never met him but the communication through emails was very good. I had a large luggage so it wasn't easy to go up the stairs when I arrived.

80123,335172,26-06-2011,591637,Ashley,"We could not have asked for a better experience!  Melanie was extremely generous, hospitable, and accommodating. She was even kind enough to provide some basic groceries for some post-flight tea and biscuits.  She was very responsive through email and text/mobile with precise directions to and from the airport, even offering to book a mini-cab and answering all of our questions.<br/><br/>The house was spotless!  It is the perfect size for 2 people and is so charmingly decorated it feels like home from the minute you arrive.  All the necessary amenities were provided (towels, linens, hairdryer, soap, wireless internet, etc).  The bed and pull out sofa were very comfortable and the bathroom was so luxurious!  The house is in a quiet, clean and safe neighborhood, and just a few minutes from the underground.  <br/><br/>We honestly had the best imaginable experience and cannot wait to visit London again so we can stay here!"
80123,608820,08-10-2011,905084,Jennifer,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 weeks and we loved it!  The coach house is newly updated, perfectly clean, and extremely comfortable.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe and the underground is less than a 10 minute walk away. Grocery stores, restaurants, cafes, and shopping are all within walking distance. The owners were very welcoming and accommodating and went out of their way to make our stay as pleasant as possible.  "
80123,664352,25-10-2011,314914,Tabea,"The Coach House was very, very nice! The setting of the house is perfect, nice neighborhood, cute little garden around it. The house is very cosy on the inside. The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom was really nice, the little kitchen had everything you needed. The place looked even nicer than it looks on the pictures. I would def. recommend this place to anyone who visits London and is looking for a calm, nice, friendly, just a great place to stay at."
80123,671274,28-10-2011,744848,Mark,"This cottage is perfect !    The hostess kindly leaves all the essential food one needs for a short stay.  You will certainly feel at home.   The cottage is fitted out to a top standard, and there is nothing missing !  For foreign visitors this is sub-urban living, but is not far from central London - 30mins on the tube; and 15mins walk.    Buy yourself a tastecard     www.tastecard.co.uk  and you can eat great meals at 50% off.   We walked to Le Chardon about 30mins and the French food was great.   "

80123,758222,01-12-2011,726211,Adriane,My husband stayed in the  cute little house while he was on business in Wandswoth and he loved it. It was quiet at night - really important for working the next day. Some breakfast and other food items were left for him which was great and convenient. He loved the staircase and the little kitchen and being able to make something to eat rather than having to eat by himself in a restaurant. He says it's really convenient and he will happily book again next time he is back. 
80123,883828,26-01-2012,1398746,Bernhard,This charming and well appointed  cottage is perfect as a tranquil base to explore London. A few minutes walk will get you to Clapham South tube station and some buses are also nearby. Melanie was a lovely and caring host (even the fridge was stocked with initial provisions) and communication was smooth and pleasant. Looking forward to book this again when I return to visit London.
80123,1077925,03-04-2012,1700695,Carlynn,"The coach house is a darling, private and homey place to stay. We enjoyed it very much. It had everything we needed to relax after a day of seeing the sights of London. Melanie and her husband were gracious hosts. It is in a great neighborhood, just a short walk to the Tube station, and a little longer walk to the train station."
80123,1307199,20-05-2012,493797,Caitlin,"Absolutely gorgeous flat in a fantastic location. My Mum stayed at the coach house for 3 weeks whilst visiting me in London. She was really happy in the flat - it is really gorgeous and cute and has everything you could need for a short break in London. Melanie was really helpful and friendly - she even left tea, milk, juice, eggs and other bits and pieces in the flat for Mum. I'd recommend this flat to anyone. "
80123,1419309,05-06-2012,2120910,Kelly,We had a great time in London and the coach house was the perfect place for our base camp (only a few tube stops from many of the places we wanted to explore). The house was in a lovely neighborhood and Melanie had all the amenities anyone would need for a short stay. Thank you Melanie!
80123,1479274,14-06-2012,2255985,Kirsty,"I booked the coachhouse for an American colleague, Lisa, who was visiting to train us, and Melanie was an amazing host!<br/>We had somehow missed that the bed is up a spiral staircase (and Lisa suffers from mobility problems!), but Melanie and her family were able to set up the sofa bed downstairs, so Lisa was very comfortable. The coach house is beautiful, and Melanie very kindly provided a fridge full of food which met Lisa's dietary requirements.<br/>Melanie was a fantastic and generous host- thank you!"
80123,1549189,24-06-2012,2441335,Bruce,"Very comfortable place, although if you have a fear of heights use the sofa bed and not the one in the loft. The host was there to meet me and left food for breakfast. The house is within walking distance of the Tube and Overground. Twenty minutes to Central London."
80123,2260097,11-09-2012,2526481,Ryan,"Melanie's coach house was great. She was very attentive and made sure someone was there to great us on our arrival. The neighborhood is fabulous, very safe, and only 10 minute walk from some great restaurants. The house is only about a 20 minute tube ride to most things in downtown London so not too bad. Especially when you spend the day in London it's nice to escape a little bit. The only small negative things I can say is, it can be a little bit noisy in the mornings with normal traffic and trucks etc passing nearby in the neighborhood,  but I'm just a light sleeper. Also, with the bed being up in the loft, sometimes getting down the spiral staircase to the bathroom in the middle of the night can be a bit tricky. Other than that, it was a great experience, I would highly recommend it!"
80123,2556661,09-10-2012,2580340,Susan,We loved staying at Melanie's little coach house in Balham.  It is very well located - just a 10 minute walk to Clapham South tube station and a 15 minute walk to Clapham overland station or to Balham high Street.  Very comfortable bed and we felt right at home.  Highly recommended.  
80123,2854551,11-11-2012,3200830,Moya,"My stay at the Coach House was a delight.  It provided every convenience and comfort.  The weather was cold but  inside it was always p,easantly warm and cosy.  Bathroom and kitchen facilities were generous in size<br/>And very clean and modern.  The private entrance allowed me to come and go without interruption to anyone.  Melanie was a charming host and though I saw little of her she was always available via email to answer any queries or provide anything required.  I wholeheartedly recommend this accommodation.  <br/>Moya Miller"
80123,2905488,18-11-2012,1624276,Todd,"Our stay here was unfortunately a bit shorter than we'd hoped since I was ill and missed the ferry from Dublin to London. As a result we were only able to stay one night.  Melanie was tremendously patient with us as we were a couple of hours late in arriving.  The coach house was adorable and quite cozy and my wife made friends with Rosie the cat who snuck in to see what we were doing.  There wasn't a lot of hot water when I took a shower but honestly, I think that's because I didn't know how to work the hot water heater.  :)<br/>We would highly recommend staying in Melanie's coach house and we hope to stay there again in the future.<br/>P.S.  - If you see Rosie, don't tell on her.  She's not really allowed in the coach house."
80123,3073894,11-12-2012,4331943,Guy,"Melanie had kindly stocked the Coach House with all the essentials for breakfast, it was immaculately clean and well equiped. The location is excellent being a short walk from Northcote Road and sitting amongst some beautiful houses in a very safe and residential area. Melanie is very kind and considerate, for the price and quality, hotels and B&B's don't compare. Ideal for a couple on a break to London or business person looking for a short term let, the place is completely self contained and private. I hesitate writing any more for fear of not finding any availbalility to rent it again... "
80123,4185748,16-04-2013,1261897,Carly,"The coach house is amazing, I had a great 2 days here. It is nice, quiet and comfortable.  Melanie was kind enough to stock the place with the necessary essentials for a short stay.<br/><br/>The property is just a short walk from Clapham South tube stop, though even though I walked during our communication Melanie was kind enough to offer to pick me up.<br/><br/>I would recommend this place to anyone!!! Thanks again Melanie."
80123,4446740,06-05-2013,2544162,Hedy,"The little coach house is exactly what you see on the photos. It's a quiet place, in the suburb of Clapham, half an hout by tube from Central London. In and out of town, so to say. We were received warmly by Melanie, with extra's in the kitchen and fridge. For us, a dissapointment came at night however. The bed upstairs was for us too small to sleep in confort. We had to split during our first night and my husband slept on the sofa downstairs.  So it went for the rest of our stay. Not exactly as I had imagined in advance... But next to this, a nice place to stay when in London."
80123,4542583,12-05-2013,4334798,Mandy,"This place is fabulous and I would definitely use it again. beautifully fitted out, very quiet, close to everything and great value. The breakfast food in the fridge and fresh fruit was wonderful after my 24 hour flight and Melanie and her husband were extremely helpful and friendly.  I have no hesitation in recommending this to anyone wanting a high quality, convenient London stay."
80123,5938918,23-07-2013,5868950,Kathryn,"We very much enjoyed our stay in Melanie's Coach House.  The guest house was lovely - nicely decorated and very comfortable.  Melanie was a very thoughtful host - she even picked us up at the train, and gave us a tour of the area.  She also stocked the guest house with breakfast necessities.  The location is perfect for getting into London on the Tube.  We would be happy to stay here on future visits to London."
80123,7260300,13-09-2013,6454002,Steve,"Lovely place, very clean and Melanie was extremely easy to arrange with.  Will look to stay again"
80123,7545143,24-09-2013,5344753,David,A lovely property and in a great location. Not for tall guests unless they sleep downstairs. Melanie is an excellent host and keeps her Coach House very well appointed. We were most greatful for the lift to the tube.
80123,7826686,05-10-2013,7454889,Sharon,"We stayed with Melanie twice, touring in between visits.The coach house is furnished to a very high standard, kitchen and bathroom are excellent and impeccably clean.Melanie is a great host and we really appreciated the stocked fridge and the bottle of wine on arrival.The coach house is very convenient to Clapham South tube station and Balham High street. Upstairs bedroom does not have a lot of headroom, but was fine for us. It is accessed by a spiral staircase would not suit anyone with mobility issues. However the downstairs sofa converts to a double bed if needed. The coach house is very affordable accommodation, close to London and we would not hesitate to stay there in the future and would certainly recommend it to others."
80123,8192227,20-10-2013,8822373,Hong Chin,Melanie is a responsible host and we enjoyed the breakfasts she made available for us to prepsre ourselves. The place is neat and clean with a modern bathroom and kitchen and it is a pleasant residentisl neighbourhood less than ten minutes walk to the tube station and shops. The bedroom is accessed by a spiral staircase and you need to mind your head here. Melanie took the trouble to drive us around to familiarise us to the neighbourhood and is easily accessible. We highly recommend this place.
80123,8484984,02-11-2013,9045070,Bettina,"We really enjoyed our stay at Melanie's coach house in the beautiful area of Clapham. The communication with Melanie was easy and engaging. Melanie was a really helpful and friendly host. The coach house looked exactly like on the photos. It was perfectly clean. Last but not least, we really enjoyed the full fridge with everything you could imagine for a perfect breakfast. We would highly recommend Melanie's coach house!"
80123,8718347,13-11-2013,9409057,Oscar,"Thank you so much for a great stay in London, we felt very much at home in this beautiful little coach house, that is as as cosy as it is it luxurious. Melanie was of great help and has an exceptional eye for detail. Merci encore, on reviendra dès qu'on en aura l'occasion ! "
80123,8833235,20-11-2013,9228704,Linda,"How refreshing to stay in a lovely Coach House instead of a hotel. I was greeted by Melanie on my arrival and she graciously took time off from her busy schedule to give me a tour of the neighborhood and even drove me the route that I would take if I used the bus service. The Coach House is a lovely sanctuary in a charming neighborhood of Clapham, just a five minute walk from the Underground, and a fifteen minute walk from Whole Foods (and a wonderful shopping district). There are a number of Café's with fresh baked pastries a few blocks from the Coach House. A safe neighborhood, I was at ease walking at all hours of the day or late at night. The wireless internet provided was flawless and worked perfectly with my tablet and phone. I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to stay there and would highly recommend Melanie’s Coach House. "
80123,8950363,27-11-2013,6827626,Roz Yemi,"Just returned from a relaxed and wonderful stay at the coach house. The photos are spot on to exactly what the quaint house looks like. Melanie was very responsive during the entire process. My husband and I found it clean, comfortable and nice. My husband cooked great meals for us there and found that he had everything (pots, pans, utensils) he needed to do that. The fridge had breakfast food for us, a full fruit bowl and even snacks in the cabinet left for us by Melanie. The house was easily accessible via tube and or taxi. The only thing that you may see consistently here is the low ceilinged loft where the bed is. We are both over 5'9"" and we had to consciously move around when we were up there, but it was not a show stopper and we would gladly stay there again on our next trip to London. Thank you Melanie for being such a thoughtful host. We will see you next time; maybe in the spring so I can swim at Bournemouth! ♥♡♥"
80123,9095231,06-12-2013,6460543,Pauline,"Lovely place, safe and accessible area, extremely well equipped, comfortable bed, great wifi and a bath to soothe the tired legs! Melanie was very welcoming and friendly and left me to my privacy, knowing that I could call if there was a problem. The fridge was well stocked for breakfast, and a good fruitbowl. I felt very pampered! Thankyou Melanie! Can I come back?"
80123,9238389,16-12-2013,7373420,Tedaa,"The coach house is beyond imagination! It is well equipped, cosy and modern. The fridge was stuffed with everything for a rich breakfast, the bed was ready to dive in and the bathroom was comfortably warm. It was wonderful to prepare dinner ""at home"", have a bath and relax on the sofa after a busy day in christmasy London. It is based in a safe area and everything, central London as well as Northcote Road and the Common (Clapham) are easy to reach. Melanie was as polite as friendly - the perfect host! Thank you for having me."
80123,9358146,23-12-2013,3356962,Mariquina,Melanie and her husband were extraordinary hosts. They made our life a lot easier in London. Thanks to them we were able to go to a concert that we would have missed because of a delay in or plane and this meant a lot to us. Melanie kept us informed at all time and she was available for anything that we could need. I would definetly recommend to stay in her lovely coach house.  
80123,9831768,13-01-2014,10540818,Lars,"The stay at the coach House was a wonderful experience! Not only did we receive a very warm and friendly welcome when we arrived around midnight, but also a little tour through the tidy and well-equipped coach house. Melanie and Nick had even been kind enough to supply us with some food in the fridge, which was a welcome surprise due to our late arrival. The coach house has a beautiful bathroom and would be a perfect fit even for an extended stay in London."
80123,10458135,19-02-2014,11401479,Laura,"Thank You Melanie!<br/>  We had a wonderful time in the Coach House.  Upon arrival Melanie had stocked the refridgerator with fresh eggs, yogurt, bread, juice and milk.  An absolute delight to not have to worry about those basics after a very long trip from the US.<br/>  The cottage is PERFECT!  Clean and cozy.  Everything you need for a quiet stay in London.  The Tube is a short walk and the neighborhood is quiet.  Just down the street are grocery stores, pubs and restaurants.  The perfect location.<br/>  Melanie was a great host.  She provided books, maps and key information to make our trip seamless.  She was always quick to respond to a question and provided great insider information on the local area.<br/>  Do not hesitate to book this location.  We were delighted with our stay and hope to be back again some day!"
80123,10485485,21-02-2014,10884842,Sarah,"Melanie was a greathost. Great at commu ication and very flexible.The Coach House was perfect . It is beautifully appointed and in a great location, close to all the amenities of Northcote Road and Clapham Common, great transport links too."
80123,10733458,04-03-2014,12592285,Fiona,"We were looking for somewhere in SW London that would be comfortable and self contained.  The house was perfect - very well appointed, generously stocked fridge and private.  Another plus was the very easy parking and a short walk to the Tube.  It makes an ideal base in that area.  The hosts were very helpful and keen to help. We enjoyed our stay there."
80123,11217335,25-03-2014,11724190,Caroline,"Absolutely spot on - a beautifully warm 'home from home' exactly as described stay :) Melanie is so helpful and it was such a great place to stay for my first few days to chill and relax.  Lovely bathroom.  Easy to get around the Common and surrounding areas.  The wifi unfortunately let me down slightly - but the message there i guess was, you don't need wifi to escape!!<br/>The is one to definitely have on your list :)"
80123,11443087,02-04-2014,4244854,Jim,"Prior to our stay with Melanie, we had booked a place with a very rude Russian host who directed us to bring a cash deposit which was a multiple of the total rental cost.  We suggested doing it through the site and pointed out in a friendly way that a cash deposit was directly against the terms of Airbnb.  Our effort was rewarded by a cancellation of our reservation the day before our arrival to London!<br/><br/>One day out the pickings were pretty slim, but we got very, very lucky!  The cancellation turned out to be a blessing in disguise because Melanie and her husband were fantastic hosts.  Their communication/friendliness was unrivaled and very welcoming especially after dealing with such a rat before them, the accommodations were great, and the location (despite being further from downtown than we had originally booked) was close to a train and tube stop which made it easy to play tourist.  She had carefully noted from my profile that I am a glutard before stocking food in the coach house as well.  I am a rookie to London, but I think it highly unlikely to find a higher quality experience for the same price point.  Someone else put it best when they wrote something to the effect, ""We are scared to write more for fear of finding availability there in the future!""  Thank you for showing us an authentic London experience and the beautiful glimpse into life there and we hope we were as high caliber of guests as you were hosts!"
80123,11582927,08-04-2014,2587737,Michel'Le,I had an amazing stay with Melanie. The house was beautiful and ideally located for pottering around London. Highly recommend the property. It is very difficult to find a hidden gem and I am glad i explored Airbnb and discovered Melanies place. Thank you again and hope to book soon.
80123,11889372,18-04-2014,5280326,Anke,"Melanie is a very nice, friendly, helpful and welcoming woman and was a wonderful hostess! <br/>For example, she has placed us food in the refrigerator, because we arrived on Sunday. <br/>Moreover she showes us the locality by car and gave us recommendations where one can drink good coffee and buy food. This was extremely nice! <br/>The house was very comfortable and nice furnished as you could see it on the pictures.<br/>I definitely recommend the house and Melanie as hostess! <br/>We had a wonderful stay there and would be really lucky to go back some day! <br/>So... we just want to say ""Thank you"" for the wonderful time we had there! <br/><br/>Nicolas and Magrit"
80123,12876633,13-05-2014,10241518,Diane,"We stayed in the 'Coach House' early May this year. Melanie made our stay very enjoyable, just the small touches such as having food & milk in the fridge, a selection of fresh fruit & breakfast items for us made the first day so easy. The accommodation was perfect for us, close to the underground & also the bus to Clapham Junction. There are also many restaurants, pubs & shops close by. <br/>The Coach House itself very comfortable, clean & easy to stay in. We were able to come & go at our leisure. I would highly recommend it if you are wanting to stay in the Clapham area."

80123,16059483,21-07-2014,4502026,Hanleys Marina,"We stayed in the 'Coach House' last weekend and found the experience  just super. Melanie made our stay very enjoyable and even with the soaring temperatures - made sure that we had fans to cool us down.<br/>The small touches such as having food & milk in the fridge are fantastic seeing as we arrived late in the evening.<br/><br/>The Coach House itself very comfortable, clean and easy to stay in and with a separate entrance we were able to come and go at our leisure. We were vising family nearby so knew our way around the area but Melanie and her husband made sure we knew everything and didn't go without (they even contacted us to let us know we left something behind that we were able tor retrieve before we made our way to the airport)<br/><br/>I would highly recommend to stay there for any type of visit to London."

A lovely touch from Melanie, was the stocked fridge for breakfast, and various bits and bobs throughout the flat - thank you for this!<br/>My husband and I would definitely stay here again in a flash!"

La location è in una tranquilla e distinta zona residenziale a 20 minuti di metro dal centro. La casetta è formata da un ampio soggiorno con soppalco raggiungibile con scaletta a chiocciola, cucinotta (con il necessario per la colazione) e ampio bagno.

It was one of our best flat rental experiences:<br/>The coach house is some 10 min walking from the tube in a nice and safe area. House is as on pictures. <br/>Communication with Melanie was easy and efficient. Melanie took greatest care with all details from food (fresh fruits, eggs, yogurt...) to water next to the beds and a big new bathroom with a fantastic shower! And everything was so clean!<br/>Melanie also drove us around showing the neighborhood which was helpful and the Spanish restaurant suggested was quite good. <br/>So overall a great place to stay which we really recommend and where we intend to stay again. Thank you Melanie."

There are people of all ages and from all segments of society but mainly children and young people. So there are much kind of services and shops which they need. Such as health, public transport, libraries, sport, leisure, clothes, groceries, supermarkets and others.<br/>Concerning the coach house looked exactly like on the photos, lovely, clean, cute, cosy, modern, comfortable, beautifully decorated, well furnished and equipped. Lovely paintings on the wall. Beautiful bathroom. The kitchen is well equipped, stocked with some snacks, tea, milk, fruit juice, eggs, biscuits, bread, fresh fruit bowl, wine, etc. And if you believe either the bed is too narrow or the ceiling of the room not high or the spiral staircase is a bit inconvenient at night you can use the sofa bed on the ground floor. There are maps, books and leaflets about London, England and other countries of UK with much information for sightseeing.<br/>Melanie is a great, helpful, thoughtful, lovely hostess. She answered quickly in all questions concerning the booking and items in the house. She was very easy available via either personally or phone or email or sms. I am very grateful to her for alter her calendar due to my family circumstances."

The Clapham South tube was only a short walk and Northcote Road with a variety of cafes and restaurants and bars to suit all tastes and little shops is also close by. <br/>Melanie made me feel very welcome and was happy to take time to chat ! The breakfast provisions were much appreciated and the little extras to make it feel like home away from home.

There was eggs, bread, jam, and oj waiting for us when we arrived. She helped get us to the place from the airport, and it was very easy. FYI- take the Gatwick Express to Victoria, then take the underground from Victoria to Clapham South. It's a short and beautiful 10 min. walk to the cottage. The location was perfect for us. It's near the metro (underground) and you pass a little gas station on your way. We stopped and got snacks everyday before heading into the city! By the end of our 11 day trip, the cottage felt like home. The place looks exactly like the pictures shown and is perfect for two people. US visitors bring power converters! But the cottage has an iron, hair dryer, and washing machine. We will definitely be back! "

80123,52697110,01-11-2015,43708015,John,Great location and great host. Full of thoughtful gestures and spotlessly clean. A real home from home and fully self-contained. A short pleasant stroll to tube station. Bed in loft area is somewhat restricted but alternative pull-out is available downstairs should this be a problem. This is the only potential drawback as in every other respect this is truly a 5-star experience.
80123,55361169,01-12-2015,33850671,Andy Hendrik,"Ein wundervoller, ruhiger Ort zum Entspannen in dem es an nichts fehlt! Wir werden auf jeden Fall wiederkommen. Die Gastgeberin ist sehr hilfsbereit und gibt Tipps. Verkehrsanbindung: 10min zu Fuß bis zur U-Bahn und dann 15-20min bis ins Zentrum. "
80123,55898047,07-12-2015,26015764,Thomas,The coach house is quite charming and Melanie was a gracious host. She thoughtfully provisioned the kitchen with food basics (and then some!) - always appreciated especially on arrival when you're jet-lagged and haven't yet figured out the lay of the land.  The house is about a 10-minute walk to the S. Clapham tube stop - a pleasant walk through this very pleasant neighborhood bordering on Clapham Common. From the tube stop it's an easy ride right into the center of London - Leicester Square is a 15-20-minute ride and the trains seem to come every 2-3 minutes. There is a low-ceilinged sleeping loft up a spiral stairway but I found it more convenient to make use of the very comfortable fold-out sofa and the ground-floor level. The kitchen and bathroom are new and well-appointed.

We really appreciated the little touches to make us feel welcome and comfortable - some fresh fruit, bottled water and some little treats in the fridge. Tastefully decorated, warm, and very comfortable. We hope to make a return visit! "
80123,60474765,24-01-2016,2048100,Boris,"Absolutely a great place to stay during your London trip! The Coach House is completly self contained and we loved all the little details. It was like an own private hotel. <br/>Location is perfect. Close to the Clapham South tube station and close to the Clapham Common and Northcote Road where there are nice restaurants and shops."
80123,63559042,24-02-2016,28521466,Mary,"This was my second stay in this wonderful coach house. The location was perfect as I have family nearby. The house is beautiful with lots of light and charming decor. Upon arrival there is breakfast food is in the refrigerator and even some wine. The bathroom is modern, the bathtub is quite large and all is very clean with lots of light from the big windows. The main room has high ceilings and plenty of room to relax, watch tv or nap on the day bed. There is a sleeping loft with a comfortable double bed. I have stayed in many holiday rentals and this by far the nicest I have used. The hosts are lovely people, very attentive to the renter's needs. I hope I am able to stay there again on another visit to London. Also, the nearby Clapham area has lots of shopping and dining options and plenty of public transportation. "

Privacy, comfort, warmth and the thoughtfulness of fresh fruit, wine and breakfast food in the fridge made me feel very welcome,  It was the perfect location as my weekend course was literally two minutes walk away. <br/>Thank you Melanie for the concert ticket - an unexpected memorable highlight to my weekend.  I hope to make a return visit .  Jane"
80123,66162528,20-03-2016,14133421,Catriona,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for 2 nights last weekend. It was a lovely stay - Melanie provided lots of fresh food in the fridge for breakfast which was great! The coach house is really nice, a good size for one or two people, very clean and in a great location a 5 minute walk from Clapham Common and the underground. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely recommend this lovely little place for anyone going to London!"
80123,70242474,17-04-2016,41415493,Jon,"My wife and I stayed here in the coach house for a week in April.  It was lovely.  The cottage is bright, quiet, and comfortable.  We enjoyed several conversations with Melanie and Nick who are very charming and were always available if need be.  As others have mentioned, Melanie and Nick are gracious hosts who gave us a orientation to the neighborhood in their car, stocked the fridge with essentials before our arrival, gave us a lift to the Tube station on departure, and shared tickets to a wonderful classical concert in the nearby church.  The location is excellent.  We enjoyed staying in a charming residential area, that is 15-20 minutes to central London by tube.  The tube station is a 10 minute walk.  We highly recommend the nearby three block area of Abbeville for the excellent restaurants and shops.  The sleeping loft is tight, but my claustrophobic wife didn't mind sleeping in it so it is manageable. We would definitely like to stay here again."
80123,71339066,24-04-2016,44543933,Jill,"We found Melanie to be a very welcoming host who volunteered her time to show us the neighbourhood. The coach house was fitted out beautifully.  It was roomy and functional, true to the photographs. It was in a great location for the tube and sainsburys.  Overall, we were extremely impressed with our stay and hope to return on our next visit "
80123,75046684,18-05-2016,44460535,Leah,"We found the coach house to be exactly as described and perfectly lovely. It was spotlessly clean, comfortable and well maintained. It was just a short walk to the tube station and the neighbourhood was the perfect respite from hustle and bustle of the city centre.<br/>We found the fridge stocked with everything we needed for our first mornings in the city, which was unbelievably helpful after a long flight and very much appreciated!<br/>Melanie was the perfect host and available to answer any questions that we had. It was a really wonderful experience to stay in her coach house and we would love to stay again. <br/>Thanks again for everything!<br/>-Leah & Adam"
80123,81889313,25-06-2016,1256342,Bill,Wonderful cozy place in a lovely quiet neighborhood. We enjoyed every minute of our stay.
80123,89683262,29-07-2016,66131127,Sorim,The cottage was fantastic. So clean. well functioned and located near metro station. The independent cottage's structure is great to stay with your company. Melanine was so thoughtful as a host. Even there were good breakfast material in the fridge. 
80123,100865751,11-09-2016,32733261,Steffan,"Melanie was a wonderful and host and even organized a few food items -that was a total surprise and very kind. The place is very peaceful and picturesque, and - as it is obvious from the images- offers a lot of privacy. I was very happy there."
80123,104107139,25-09-2016,70296805,Irene,"It is my first visit to London with my friend and we spent 8 days here. Melanie and Nick are attentive and helpful hosts who picked us from the Tube Station on our arrival,  stocked the fridge with essentials for our breakfast in the next morning.<br/>The coach house locates at a quiet residential area and it takes 10 minutes walk to the tube station and about 25 minutes to central London by tube. It is exactly as described and is very clean and comfortable.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay here and hope to return in our next visit."
80123,106126577,04-10-2016,21749669,Tracey,"My husband and I had a terrific 5 night stay in the Coach house.  It is appointed with everything you could possibly need, is cosy and very tastefully decorated. Melanie had stocked the apartment with various treats which were not expected but truly put her into the Superhost level. The location of the Coach house is close to underground ( Clapham South) being a 7 min walk , Northcote rd and also a delightful organic Spanish cafe on Webb st which had the best coffee and pastries we've had in London. We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Melanie "
80123,108517593,16-10-2016,67366615,Andres Santiago,"El Coach House de Melanie es tal cual se ve en las fotos y como está en la descripción. Melanie es una mujer excepcional que se encargó de hacer nuestra estancia más cómoda. <br/><br/>Muy recomendado para una estancia de vacaciones en Londres, tuvo detalles tan especiales como una tarjeta de bienvenida felicitándonos por nuestro matrimonio, así como dejar la nevera con cosas para el desayuno, algo que uno agradece cuando llega tarde y no hay donde comprar cosas a esa hora.<br/><br/>De nuevo, 100% recomendado!!"
80123,111381906,31-10-2016,8677712,Jess,"A truly lovely, well appointed base for any London stay. The area, with its pleasant serenity, feels far removed from the craziness of central London and yet is located within easy walking distance of public transport and a bustling neighborhood filled with quality restaurants and shops. The coach house is cheerful, tidy, and stocked with every amenity you could need for a comfortable stay. (Even the fridge and cupboards were filled with provisions!) Melanie was exceptionally gracious - attentive, patient, receptive, and endlessly thoughtful and understanding. I recommend this listing without reservation - you won't be disappointed!"
80123,115160850,22-11-2016,86683173,Chiara,"The cozy coach house is the perfect spot for any couple traveling together. My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights at Melanie's and felt very comfortable. The coach house is located in a very safe quiet neighborhood with easy access to both the underground station (if you choose to venture into central London) and also a short walk to the local town of Wandsworth. We loved the quaint town Wandsworth, there are lots of little shops and restaurants along the main strip and was a nice change of pace from the bustling city. As a host, Melanie was very informative and helpful. We used everything she suggested to us and were very thankful to have her show us around the town when we first arrived. We would absolutely recommend Melanie and her home for anyone staying in London. We will most definitely be back!"
80123,117000643,04-12-2016,96682941,Sally,a very eell equipped property with loads of character.

80123,136549895,11-03-2017,576930,Megan,"What a lovely place Melanie has! Comfortable, quiet, close to the Tube and other trains. This house felt like almost too much space for the two of us (after small flats in France and Amsterdam), but we really enjoyed uncurling and settling into the bigger space, and it was quite enjoyable.<br/>The house itself is set away from the main house and has its own entrance and amenities, including kitchen (with everything), bathroom (with everything), loft with bed, living area with TV and extra sofa bed. It was wonderful. Extras: laundry, and snacks and staples in the fridge. Was so welcome and wonderful. <br/>We walked to the tube every day ~10 minutes. Took 10-15 minutes from the Clapham South tube to get into the center of the city. If that. Not bad at all. And the surrounding neighborhood has tons of restaurants, people out and about running and playing in the nearby Clapham Common. <br/>Great way to get both the big London experience, and then also small, authentic English neighborhood feel. Melanie and her husband are wonderful, gracious hosts!<br/>Loved our stay! Highly recommend! "
80123,143112632,10-04-2017,3312194,Cathie,Just spent 3 weeks staying at Melanie's Coach House in London. Suited us perfectly and it is very well located to all local amenities. Easy access via tube or bus to central London and all the main tourist attractions.
80123,152134955,15-05-2017,121584586,Kate,"We loved our stay at Melanie's coach house! The town offers so much from restaurants to shopping, and Melanie really did an amazing job welcoming us! Highly recommend!!"
80123,153892468,22-05-2017,761927,Susan,"Loved staying in a residential area! The space was bright and clean. We used the loft bed and you just need to watch your head. As others have mentioned very walkable to tube and local groceries and restaurants. Melanie was very accommodating with our check-in time and that was very much appreciated. We spent late Sunday reading the paper in the garden supervised by Rosie the cat (who is not allowed in the rental space). The tube connections all run off of the Northern line, so you just need to allow for transfer time and the walking. We made use of the kitchen and found everything we needed for light meal prep. A very affordable little gem in a London residential neighborhood!"
80123,160211805,13-06-2017,53374916,Chris,"We stayed at Melanie's coachhouse for 5 nights and totally loved it. The extras provided by Melanie as in bread, juice, fruit, milk, eggs, croissants and a nice bottle of wine were most welcomed. <br/>The bathroom is very modern and spacious and served us well for our stay. I enjoyed our time here and slept well in the upstairs loft bedroom. <br/>Clapham Common is a short walk away, as is Clapham South tube."
80123,173830731,24-07-2017,118638205,Arnoldo,Centrally located in Zone 2. 15 minute walking  distant  to underground transit. Quite  area with good amenities close by.<br/>Wonderful  and pleasant hostess.

80123,200121477,04-10-2017,24651849,Elizabeth,"Our stay at the coach house was fantastic! The space was much larger than expected, and the location was great - extremely quiet and only a short walk from the tube station, as well as shops and restaurants at places like Northcote Road. Melanie was super helpful during the reservation process, and even provided staples like bread, eggs, milk, etc. in the fridge when we arrived. It felt like a home away from home during our trip, and we hope to be back for another visit!"
80123,205380883,22-10-2017,84637969,Jodi,"Melanie place was beyond our expectations, it was super great, and we are really like it, melanie provided everything thay we need and she is very communicative, we do recommend melanie place for everyone that looking for a place to stay in London!"

80123,217801780,10-12-2017,3969781,Monique,"Confortable, well located and affordable place to stay while visiting London. It is located within walking distance to a subway station, several bus stops, a supermarket, several restaurants, a pub and a café. The neighbourghood is safe, fairly quiet and pleasant. The house is well furnished and equipped for cooking simple meals and resting after a busy day in tthe city. Melanie was an attentive and friendly host. Highly recommended!"

80123,259129833,30-04-2018,12759646,Riccardo,"La minuscola casetta è davvero deliziosa e funzionale.  Abbiamo anche cucinato e mangiato nel microscopico cucinino! Il bagno, al contrario, è ampio e funzionale: tutte le apparecchiature e gli elettrodomestici sono di qualità e in perfetta efficienza e il riscaldamento funziona egregiamente. Melanie ci ha fatto trovare un piccolo kit di sopravvivenza (pane, burro salato, yogurth, uova, frutta, succo e una piccola bottiglia di vino), particolari e attenzioni assai piacevoli e graditi che ci hanno per altro salvato la vita quando abbiamo scoperto che l'unico pub nelle vicinanaze aveva già chiuso la cucina all'ora del nostro arrivo. Il quartiere e tranquillissimo e piacevole, con piccole ed eleganti linde casette ma, appunto, non è proprio il centro della movida londinese per cui va gestito un po' come un grosso paesotto, con orari e abitudini da grosso paesotto. La fermata della metro dista una decina di minuti a piedi e per arrivare a Central London ci vuole una mezz'ora di metropolitana."
80123,261434834,06-05-2018,18440626,Audrey,"Melanie’s place is very nice, well located and with a beautiful outdoor space"

80123,269367790,27-05-2018,6474024,Stephen,Wonderful place! Melanie and her husband were very welcoming and very accommodating of our late arrival. A very nice and stylish space. Wish we could have stayed longer.<br/>
80123,280451786,23-06-2018,179644090,Alexander,"Melanie's place was delightful. It was about a half mile from the tube (clapham south, on the edge of zone 2&3)  <br/>On our first evening we went to the local pub on night (nightengale) as we were tired from traveling. We explored the street that Melanie had suggested and enjoyed lunch there on our last day. <br/>We were able to do laundry and relax at the Airbnb. Melanie had provided some essentials for breakfast in the fridge (so nice!). My wife was a little claustrophobic of upstairs so we slept on the day bed that is pulled open to a normal sized bed."
80123,288949178,11-07-2018,125878771,Karen,"Melanie's place is highly recommended. I don't live far and rented Melanie's place for my sister and her husband that came to visit me and stayed for 11 days.  The sofa bed is comfortable as a bed, modern and big bathroom with soft towels, plenty of space, you have all privacy and freedom needed even though it is a coach house.  Melanie received us with fruits, breakfast groceries and a small bottle of wine, she also delivered fresh towels at some point, all really nice of her. Communication was excellent too. I would book for future visitors again.  "
80123,295873864,24-07-2018,20859929,Wayne,"Everything about our stay at Melanie's place was 5-star: the hospitality, amenities, her commication, cleanliness, charm, and location! Thanks to Nick too who, upon our arrival, oriented us with a tour of the immediate vicinity. A lovely walk through a beautiful neighborhood brought us conveniently to the Clapham South underground station. What's more, there were eggs, bread, yogurt, jam, and juice in the fridge. Thanks for creating such a beautiful place for us which we will always treasure as a memory during our time in London!"
80123,320861159,09-09-2018,2289410,Hendrik,The coach house was bigger than I expected and the place was spotless. We had a very pleasant stay. Melanie welcomed me when I arrived and communication with her prior my arrival was perfect.<br/>The late check out time and breakfast were a plus as well. <br/>5***** :)
80123,337465851,16-10-2018,3451894,Martin,"As a coach house set away from the main house, you have privacy but Melanie isn't far away either which is good to know just in case. The coach house feels very new and had everything we needed. Melanie left some breakfast treats and there was also some tea/coffee, salt/pepper etc which not every place has but it was definitely appreciated. The area itself is in a very clean and safe area of London surrounded by residential streets and parks in either direction. It is not too far away from some local shops and pubs as well. Communication and flexibility in check-in was great. I'd recommend Melanie's coach house to anyone."
80123,342105802,28-10-2018,11449218,Pierre,"We spent two days in Melanie's house and had a great stay.

80123,346937739,10-11-2018,21715212,Dirk,"Das kleine Häuschen liegt ca. 10 Minuten Fußweg von der Station Clapham South entfernt, und man ist recht flott in der Stadtmitte. Obwohl es in einem ruhigen Wohngebiet liegt, sind ein Supermarkt mit langen Öffnungszeiten und ein toller Pub mit echt gutem Essen und vielen Biersorten (the Nightingale) sehr nah gelegen - ca. 5 Minuten, so dass man auch für den ersten Abend wenn man spät ankommt gut versorgt ist. Check In und die Infos zur Anreise von Melanie waren toll und unkompliziert. Was das Schlafen betrifft, kann man sich entscheiden ob man lieber oben im Giebel oder unten auf einem ausziehbaren Bett schläft (beides breite Betten). Bad und Küche sind super geräumig und man hat alles was es braucht. Eine kleine Grundausstattung an Lebensmitteln mit Wasser, Milch, Obst, Brot und leckerer Marmelade lag schon zu unserer Ankunft bereit, was uns sehr gefreut hat. Wir haben uns bei Melanie und ihrem Mann sehr willkommen gefühlt, und ich kann das kleine Häuschen nur empfehlen !"
80123,351945046,24-11-2018,12352929,Brittany,Lovely getaway in Clapham South! I booked Melanie's cottage for my parents while visiting me in London. The cottage was extremely convenient by location and has lots of cozy charm. There's a beautiful garden/patio space that would have been lovely if the weather was nicer that week. Melanie was very easy to communicate with and left breakfast foods for my parents to enjoy - she was a very thoughtful and considerate host!
80123,354695514,02-12-2018,9261404,Woon Nee,"It was a great stay at Melanie’s place. My bf like it very much as this is his first time staying at ABNB and he was impressed by it. It gave us a different experience to live in a neighbourhood place in London but yet convenient to travel to the city. Melanie is a very thoughtful host in term of arranging the key and tips for the restaurants surrounding. Highly recommend for the nearby Italian restraint Numero Uno, one of the best I ever tried. Overall, reasonable price, good location, and worth for the second stay if I ever travel to London again. Thanks Melanie."
80123,359896068,18-12-2018,94354460,Elizabeth,A wonderful self contained space in a great location-near everything!<br/>And a Melanie is a super hostess!
80123,406886540,31-01-2019,17189246,Nancy,The cottage is absolutely adorable and very comfortable - Melanie provides everything you will need for a short or extended stay. The photos accurately show the space and it is very nice to be in a separate cottage. Melanie is the perfect host in my opinion - she is available if needed but doesn't fuss over you.
80123,412385877,15-02-2019,25158557,Sophie,"My mom and I stayed here for 5 days and had a really great experience. Lovely and responsive host, and we fell in love with the area. Highly recommend!"

80123,439071530,18-04-2019,31399157,Ina,Der Aufenthalt bei Melanie war ein Traum. Die Unterkunft ist wunderschön und ruhig gelegen. In dem kleinen Häuschen gibt es alles was man braucht. Die Anbindung an die Stadtmitte ist gut. Aber der Stadtteil selbst ist auch sehr hübsch. <br/>Besonders zu erwähnen ist die Hilfsbereitschaft der Gastgeberin über das normale Maß hinaus. Wir haben uns wie bei Freunden gefühlt. Dafür 1000 Dank.

80123,527975564,12-09-2019,51071045,Jacob,"This Carriage House had everything we needed for a home base while exploring London for a week. Melanie was incredibly kind and even provided GF bread for my wife. If we ever return to London, we will absolutely be hoping to stay here again."
80123,534874316,23-09-2019,6394308,Caroline,"The Coach House is a lovely and special spot. The space is sweetly appointed. It is not large,   but extremely comfortable and well laid out, and set in a pretty garden like setting (complete with  grapevines.) Melanie thoughtfully stocks the kitchen with breakfast foods (and in our case sought out  tasty vegan options to satisfy my daughter.)  The neighborhood is charming and only a short walk away are a delicious patisserie,  pub, and even an antiques market, among other local  shops.   We didn't have time to visit the nearby parks, but enjoyed walking by them on the way to the tube station at Clapham South, from which it is just a short ride into central London.  One of the most memorable and delightful places I  have stayed at while travelling."

80123,562109990,10-11-2019,208965021,Bill,We loved staying in this adorable couch house. It felt like coming “home” to a toasty warm refuge after a full day of sightseeing. The neighbourhood is lovely with near by pubs and restaurants. Melanie is very kind and thoughtful. There were fresh eggs and milk and fresh fruit a long with a few other provisions stocked in the fridge. We hope to return one day!
80123,570399418,29-11-2019,24651849,Elizabeth,"This was our second stay at Melanie’s, and we were looking forward to returning after a great first visit. As expected, the coach house was well equipped with all the conveniences you could need, and Melanie is great with check-in and responses to any questions. The coach house is located within walking distance to great restaurants, shops, and the tube, and it a quiet place out of the hustle and bustle of the center of London. We hope to be back again!"
80123,592013513,12-01-2020,83467826,Rosalie,Melanie is a lovely host.  Her home was delightful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time in her beautiful carriage house.  Highly recommend.

The carriage house was so clean, comfortable, wonderfully decorated, and had all the amenities to make for a great stay. Melanie was so attentive, kind, and helpful in every way you could imagine, and we did not have a single worry during our time in the air bnb. My husband has a dairy allergy, and she even stocked us up with some wonderful dairy free foods. The location of the air bnb is wonderful, close enough and very easy to the center of London, but also in a more relaxing location. I would definitely stay at Melanie’s air bnb in the future!"
